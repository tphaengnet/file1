"Solid Waste Management Awareness, Attitude, and Practices in a Philippine Catholic Higher Education Institution","© 2017, University of San Jose-Recoletos. All rights reserved.The paper assesses the solid waste management awareness, attitude, and practices of the employees and students of a Catholic higher education institution in the Philippines. Using a descriptive research design, the data were collected using a self-administered survey questionnaire and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The major findings of the study show that the respondents demonstrated a very high level of awareness and attitude and high extent of practice of solid waste management. A significant difference was found in the awareness, attitude, and practices of respondents when they were grouped according to status and religion. Also, the findings established the relationship between awareness and attitude on one hand and the extent of practice of solid waste management. Awareness, attitudes, and practices were significantly related to age and educational level, except for sex which showed no correlation with attitude and practices. Generally, this paper validates how knowledge influences attitude that subsequently determines behavior particularly in solid waste management as intervened by appropriate environmental education.","['University of Negros Occidental- Recoletos', 'Silliman University']",['Philippines'],"['Madrigal D.V.', 'Oracion E.G.']","['Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Practices', 'Solid Waste Management']",Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal,University of San Jose-Recoletos,['Multidisciplinary'],['MULT'],Article,9,43.0,2017
Economic Decision across Regions of the Philippines,"© 2017, University of San Jose-Recoletos. All rights reserved.This study determines why Gross Regional Domestic Product per Capita (GRDP) differs across regions in the Philippines vis-à-vis population rate, tertiary graduate rate, and crime rate as factors. Using Minitab, it examines the secondary data sets based on every group from various regions of the country. Findings show that educated human capital converge more in highly developed areas where risks matter less and safety measures exist. This results to a concentrated high GRDP in some. It further reveals that index and non-index crime rate is not a hindrance for a person to move in the area with many opportunities as long as life is not at stake. There were more educated individuals in regions with lower GRDP; however, they practiced and worked in highly developed areas and where law is enforced, eyeinga better condition of life. By implication, it results to concentration of educated labor force in areas with better opportunities.",['Southern Leyte State University'],['Philippines'],['Ordiz J.E.G.'],"['economic disparity', 'multivariate analysis', 'risks taking']",Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal,University of San Jose-Recoletos,['Multidisciplinary'],['MULT'],Article,0,22.0,2017
Evaluating Philippine Students’ Class Participation with a Token Currency System,"© 2017, University of San Jose-Recoletos. All rights reserved.Although past studies have validated the importance of active class participation in facilitating student learning, evaluating class participation remains a major issue. This study applies a token economy system to a Philippine university by awarding token currency to students who contributed meaningfully in class. After course completion, an online survey was administered to the 65 participating students, of which there were 26 completed responses. There was no evidence that the token economy increased student performance. However, survey results, coupled with student feedback, suggest that using a token economy is a viable alternative to traditional methods of evaluating student participation.",['University of the Philippines Cebu'],['Philippines'],['Yu S.Q.'],"['class participation', 'token economy']",Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal,University of San Jose-Recoletos,['Multidisciplinary'],['MULT'],Article,0,58.0,2017

Stimulating economic recovery through euro area growth poles: Call for more directed unconventional monetary policy measures?,"© Institute of Economic Research.Research background: Transfer of newly created money through unconventional monetary measures follows the official European Central Bank distribution key. Yet, it does not take into account the ability of individual countries to drive growth process in other economies. Money spent to boost domestic credit provisioning in growth pole-like economies is more likely to spill over to other adjoined economies and help them to recover, even in the presence of depressed domestic demand and/or overleveraged domestic banking sector. Purpose of the article: This paper reports growth pole scores for 19 euro area countries, and compares it to the official distribution key used to transmit newly created source of funding. Methods: We modify the procedure developed in World Bank (2011) for growth pole computation in order to account for strength of linkages connecting member states. Findings & Value added: Our results suggest that the official distribution key might not be completely optimal once looking at the growth pole scores. Countries small in economic size (Baltic states, Slovakia and Slovenia) would benefit from a more differentiated distribution, as they strongly outperform their benchmark set by the official distribution key. On theother hand, big euro area economies do not achieve the levels used in official distribution key, taking into account their growth pole potential for other euro area economies.","['Slovak Academy of Sciences', 'University of Economics Bratislava']",['Slovakia'],"['Siranova M.', 'Kotlebova J.']","['Growth pole', 'Network analysis', 'Unconventional monetary policy']",Equilibrium.

The Future of Nietzsche’s Perspectivism as Political Consensus,"© 2017, University of San Jose-Recoletos. All rights reserved.In this paper, I delve on Nietzsche’s concept of perspectivism and how it becomes relevant amid contemporary society’s openness to relative standpoints. The foremost era that reflects this description points to postmodernism as a politics of difference. Nietzsche’s perspectivism is generally a critique of the conditions that absolutize truth. While this may seem a valiant opening for a welcoming era on an epistemological standpoint, it does not however do away with its own paradoxes. I contend whether this fits well with postmodernism and its ironic relationship to truth and asserts further that the conditions for Nietzsche’s perspectivism can only achieve its future if it hermeneutically stands as political consensus. Later, I will present the features of this perspectivism as political consensus and how it can be viable in postmodernity.",['Leyte Normal University'],['Philippines'],['Kahambing J.G.'],"['Nietzsche', 'Paradoxes', 'Perspectivism', 'Political Consensus', 'Postmodernism']",Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal,University of San Jose-Recoletos,['Multidisciplinary'],['MULT'],Article,1,50.0,2017

Intracellular Delivery of β-Galactosidase Enzyme Using Arginase-Responsive Dextran Sulfate/Poly- l -arginine Capsule for Lysosomal Storage Disorder,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.β-Galactosidase (β-gal) is one of the important lysosomal enzymes that is involved in the breakdown of glycosphingolipids (e.g., GM1 ganglioside), and its deficiency leads to GM1 Gangliosidosis, a lysosomal storage disorder (LSD). Intracellular delivery of β-gal is one of the preferable methods to treat this kind of LSDs. However, it cannot permeate the cell membrane due to its intricate macromolecular nature, low stability, and degradation by endogenous proteases. To this end, we report efficient intracellular delivery of β-gal via arginase-responsive dextran sulfate/poly-l-arginine polymer capsules (DS/PA capsules). The therapeutic activity of β-gal enzyme has been assessed in two gene-deficient diseased cell lines, SV (β-galactosidase gene-deficient mouse fibroblast) and R201C (deficient human β-galactosidase gene-introduced mouse fibroblast), and in wild-type mouse fibroblast immortalized cell lines. The activity of β-gal enzyme has been estimated within cells by using fluorescein isothiocyanate-cholera toxin B as a florescent probe that illustrates the level of GM1 ganglioside, the β-gal substrate. We found 1.8-, 3.4-, and 2.8-fold reduction in the substrate level in R201C, SV, and wild-type mouse fibroblast, respectively, which confirms the release and therapeutic activity of β-gal enzyme inside the cells. Moreover, enzyme delivery in gene-deficient diseased cell lines (SV and R201C) via DS/PA capsules reduced the level of enzyme substrate to a normal endogenous level, which is present in untreated wild-type mouse fibroblast cells. We note that loading of β-gal enzyme within DS/PA capsules was estimated to be 3 mU per hundred capsules and more than 77% of β-gal is released within 12 h. Overall, these results highlight the potential of DS/PA capsules as an efficient delivery carrier for therapeutic enzyme.","['Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University', 'Centre for Environmental Science &amp; Engineering', 'Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences']",['India'],"['Sivakumar S.', 'Gupta M.', 'Pandey H.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,8,46.0,2017
Versatile Controls of Microdomain Morphologies and Temperature Dependencies in Lamellar Spacing by Blending Diblock Copolymers Bearing Antisymmetric Compositions,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.The morphologies of the microphase-separated structures in the binary blends of diblock copolymers (AB/AB) have been studied intensively for the case of diblock copolymers bearing antisymmetric compositions with similar molecular weights. Here, the two diblock copolymers 1 and 2, of which compositions are 0.5 - x and 0.5 + x (0 < x < 0.5), respectively, were blended, and the morphology diagram was constructed in the plot of χZ vs the average composition of the A component, where χ is the interaction parameter between A and B segments and Z is the average degree of polymerization of the two AB diblock copolymers. The temperature-dependent morphologies were analyzed by synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements. It was found that the morphology diagram agrees in principle with the theoretical one for the neat AB diblocks by Matsen and Bates (Macromolecules 1996, 29, 1091-1098), although the disordered phase was a bit expanded in the experimentally determined morphology diagram. Anomalous temperature dependencies in the lamellar spacing have been also comprehensively studied for the binary blends of antisymmetric diblock copolymers as a function of the degree of compositional asymmetry by closely adjusting the average composition in the blend specimen at 0.50. For this purpose, more than 20 neat diblock copolymers have been synthesized with a wide range of compositions from 0.20 to 0.87 and a range of molecular weight of 12000-33800. The temperature dependencies of the lamellar spacing were also analyzed by synchrotron SAXS measurements. As a result, the following things were found. The scaling exponent α in D ∼ Tα was still negative but slightly larger than the usual value (i.e., α = -0.33) for the smaller degree of asymmetry in the composition (i.e., x is small), while α became positive for the higher degree of asymmetry. The latter result is very anomalous because the temperature dependence is opposite (i.e., the lamellar spacing increases with an increase of temperature). The value of α was found to be linearly rationalized with the degree of asymmetry τ (which is especially introduced in the current paper for this purpose), for the binary blends with the average composition of 0.50. Based on this result, one can prepare lamellar microdomains, of which spacing does not change with temperature, by blending two diblock copolymers with τ = 1.33 (corresponding to 0.3 and 0.7 of compositions) having similar molecular weights. This would be important for manufacturing materials with properties (for instance, the optical property) independent of temperature. From the current study, the binary blends of the antisymmetric diblock copolymers are concluded to be versatile such that the precise controls of the morphologies and the temperature dependencies of the lamellar microdomains are plausible.","['Nagoya Institute of Technology', 'Kyoto Institute of Technology', 'Kyoto University']",['Japan'],"['Sakurai S.', 'Yamamoto K.', 'Yasui A.', 'Fukuhara J.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,1,63.0,2017
Electricity on Rubber Surfaces: A New Energy Conversion Effect,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.This work describes the conversion of mechanical energy to electricity, by periodically stretching rubber tubing and allowing it to relax. The rubber surface shows periodic and reversible electrostatic potential variations, in phase with the tubing length. The potential change depends on the elastomer used: silicone loses charge when stretched and becomes strongly negative when relaxed, whereas the stretched natural rubber is positive, becoming negative when relaxed. Every other elastomeric material that was tested also showed periodic potential but followed different patterns. When the motion stops, the potential on the resting samples decreases quickly to zero. The potential oscillation amplitude decreases when the relative humidity decreases from 65 to 27%, but it is negligible when the rubber tubing is previously swollen with water or paraffin oil. Elastomer charging patterns do not present the well-known characteristics of piezo-, flexo-, or triboelectricity, and they are discussed considering rubber rheology, wear, and surface properties, including the possibility of surface piezoelectricity. The following mechanism is suggested: rubber stretching provokes chemical and morphology changes in its surface, followed by a change in the surface concentration of H+ and OH- ions adsorbed along with water. The possibility of the occurrence of similar variations in other systems (both inert and biological) is discussed, together with its implications for energy scavenging from the environment.","['Universidade Federal de Santa Maria', 'Universidade Estadual de Campinas']",['Brazil'],"['Galembeck F.', 'Batista B.C.', 'Burgo T.A.L.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,15,57.0,2017
Sensing Cellular Metabolic Activity via a Molecular-Controlled Semiconductor Resistor,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Over the last decade, we have developed a molecular-controlled semiconductor resistor (MOCSER) device that is highly sensitive to variations in its surface potentials. This device was applied as a molecular sensor both in the gas phase and in solutions. The device is based on an AlGaAs/GaAs structure. In the current work, we developed an electronic biosensor for real-time, label-free monitoring of cellular metabolic activity by culturing HeLa cells directly on top of the device's conductive channel. Several properties of GaAs make it attractive for developing biosensors, among others its high electron mobility and ability to control the device's properties by proper epitaxial growing. However, GaAs is very reactive and sensitive to oxidation in aqueous solutions, and its arsenic residues are highly toxic. Nevertheless, we have managed to overcome this inherent chemical instability by developing a surface-protecting layer using polymerized (3-mercaptopropyl)-trimethoxysilane (MPTMS). To improve cell adhesion and biocompatibility, the MPTMS-coated devices were further modified with an additional layer of (3-aminopropyl)-trimethoxysilane (APTMS). HeLa cells were found to grow successfully on these devices, and MOCSER devices cultured with these cells were stable and sensitive to cellular metabolic activity. The sensitivity of the MOCSER device results from the sensing of extracellular acidification in the microenvironment of the cell-MOCSER interspace. We have found that this sensitivity is maintained only when the device is partially covered with the cellular layer, whereas at full coverage the sensitivity is lost. This phenomenon is related to the negatively charged cellular membrane potentials that lead to a reduction in the channel's conductivity. We propose that the coated MOCSER device can be applied for real-time and continuous monitoring of cellular viability and activity.",['Weizmann Institute of Science Israel'],['Israel'],"['Ainbinder E.', 'Kolker Baravik I.', 'Naaman R.', 'Capua E.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,2,40.0,2017
Probing Stress-Induced Optical Birefringence of Glassy Polymers by Whispering Gallery Modes Light Localization,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.An optical resonance method for the determination of the strain- and stress-optical coefficients of optically transparent polymers is presented and exemplified for monodisperse and bidisperse molecular weight polystyrene (PS). This method employs whispering gallery modes (WGMs) resonation inside a spheroid polymeric cavity, suspended on an optical fiber taper waist, which, in turn, is used for subjecting the polymeric resonator to controlled strain conditions. The wavelength shifts of equal order transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarization WGMs are measured, as well as their relative birefringence versus applied strain. For monodisperse PS microspheroids (2 and 50 kDa) the stress-optical coefficient is negative, contrary to the results for bulk PS in the glassy state indicating different phenyl group orientation of the PS monomer with respect to the strain direction. In the bidisperse (2 and 50 kDa) spheroid with a symmetric monomer composition, local structural irregularities are probably responsible for the observed coupling between WGMs. The method possesses metrological capabilities for probing the molecular orientation of polymer-based resonators.","['University of Surrey', 'University of Crete', 'Institute of Electronic Structure and Laser of the Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas', 'Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research']","['United Kingdom', 'Germany', 'Greece']","['Fytas G.', 'Aluculesei A.', 'Milenko K.', 'Gkantzounis G.', 'Pissadakis S.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,11,35.0,2017
High-Yield Production of Fatty Nitriles by One-Step Vapor-Phase Thermocatalysis of Triglycerides,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Fatty nitriles are widely used as intermediate molecules in the pharmaceutical and polymer industries. In addition, hydrogenation of fatty nitriles produces fatty amines that are common surfactants. In the conventional fatty nitrile process, triglycerides are first hydrolyzed and the resulting fatty acids are catalytically reacted with NH3 in a liquid-phase reaction. In this study, we report a simpler one-step fatty nitrile production method that involves a direct vapor-phase reaction of triglycerides with NH3 in the presence of heterogeneous solid acid catalysts. The reactions were performed in a tubular reactor maintained at 400 °C into which triglycerides were injected through an atomizer to allow rapid volatilization and reaction; NH3 was fed as a gas. Several metal oxide catalysts were tested, and reactions in the presence of V2O5 resulted in near-theoretical fatty nitrile yields (84 wt % relative to the feed mass). In general, catalysts with higher acidity such as V2O5, Fe2O3, and ZnO showed higher fatty nitrile yields compared to low acidity catalysts such as ZrO, Al2O3, and CuO. Energy balance calculations indicate that the one-step reaction described here would require significantly lower energy than the conventional process primarily because of the elimination of the energy-intense triglyceride hydrolysis.","['Manhattan College', 'University of California, Riverside', 'The University of Toledo']",['United States'],"['Tafazolian H.', 'Heben M.J.', 'Varanasi S.', 'Song Z.', 'Viamajala S.', 'Shirazi Y.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,24,33.0,2017
Charge-Driven Interaction of Antimicrobial Peptide NK-2 with Phospholipid Membranes,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.NK-2, derived from a cationic core region of NK-lysin, displays antimicrobial activity toward negatively charged bacterial membranes. We have studied the interaction of NK-2 with various phospholipid membranes, using a variety of experimental techniques, such as, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), potential, and dynamic light scattering. As bacteria mimicking membranes, we have chosen large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) composed of negatively charged phospholipid and neutral phospholipids. ITC and potential results show the stronger binding affinity of NK-2 to negatively charged membranes than to neutral membranes. Saturation of the isotherm, obtained from ITC, at a given lipid to NK-2 ratio, was found to be consistent with the charge compensation, determined from potential. A surface partition model with electrostatic contribution was used to estimate the intrinsic binding constant and other thermodynamical parameters of binding kinetics of NK-2. The size distribution of negatively charged LUV in the presence of NK-2 was found to increase drastically, indicating the presence of large aggregates. Such a large aggregate has not been observed in neutral membranes, which supports the ITC and potential results.",['Jadavpur University'],['India'],"['Karmakar S.', 'Halder A.', 'Maity P.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,16,35.0,2017
Drug-Triggered Self-Assembly of Linear Polymer into Nanoparticles for Simultaneous Delivery of Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Drugs in Breast Cancer Cells,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Breast cancer is the most devastating disease among females globally. Conventional chemotherapeutic regimen relies on the use of highly cytotoxic drugs as monotherapy and combination therapy leading to severe side effects to the patients as collateral damage. Moreover, combining hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs create erratic biodistribution and suboptimal medicinal outcome. Hence, packaging multiple drugs of diverse mechanisms of action and biodistribution for safe delivery into tumor tissues with optimal dosages is indispensable for next-generation breast cancer therapy. To address these, in this report, we describe a unique cisplatin-triggered self-assembly of linear polymer into 3D-spherical sub 200 nm particles. These nanoparticles comprise a hydrophobic (paclitaxel) and hydrophilic drug (cisplatin) simultaneously in a single particle. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed hydrophilic-hydrophilic interaction and interchain H-bonding as underlying mechanisms of self-assembly. Confocal microscopy studies evidently demonstrated that these novel nanoparticles can home into lysosomes in breast cancer cells, fragment subcellular nuclei, and prevent cell division, leading to improved breast cancer cell death compared to free drug combination. Moreover, 3D-breast tumor spheroids were reduced remarkably by the treatment of these nanoparticles within 24 h. These dual-drug-loaded self-assembled polymeric nanoparticles have prospective to be translated into a clinical strategy for breast cancer patients.","['National Chemical Laboratory India', 'Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Pune']",['India'],"['Palvai S.', 'Lahiri M.', 'Basu S.', 'Sarkar S.', 'Anandi L.', 'Roy S.', 'Augustus M.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,12,59.0,2017

Resolution of Racemic Mixtures by Phase Transition of PEGylated Resolving Agents,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.A novel, efficient, and simple method for the resolution of racemic mixtures is presented in which PEGylated resolving agents are subjected to diastereomeric complex formation in alcohols. The resulting complexes then undergo temperature-assisted phase transition, affording a precipitate that is enriched in one enantiomer and separable by filtration. In an aqueous solution, phase transition can be caused by the methods used in the precipitation of poly(ethylene glycol) (e.g., addition of ammonium sulfate). A number of racemic amines have been successfully resolved using this method. The first cycle of resolution affords the amines with an optical purity of 72-85% from their corresponding racemic mixture in good yields (78-90%). An additional cycle improved the optical purity to 87-95%. The PEGylated resolving agents can be recovered and reutilized without the loss of resolution efficiency.","['Islamic Azad University, Science and Research Branch', 'University of Tehran', 'Arasto Pharmaceutical Chemicals Inc.']",['Iran'],"['Azarnoosh S.', 'Mokhtari J.', 'Karimian K.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,3,52.0,2017

"Structure, Stability, and Kinetics of Vacancy Defects in Monolayer PtSe2: A First-Principles Study","© 2017 American Chemical Society.The recent epitaxial growth of monolayer PtSe2 has raised hope for its novel applications in valleytronic, spintronic, and energy-harvesting devices. Compared with 2H-phase transition-metal dichalcogenides, the 1T-phase PtSe2 is much less studied and this is especially true for its defects behaviors and their influence on electronic properties. In this article, we systemically explore the structure, stability, and kinetics of both Pt and Se vacancies in monolayer PtSe2 using first-principles calculations. By examining the relative energies of these vacancies, we identify the most stable Se/Pt single and double vacancies. In particular, we reveal a new type of Se double vacancy structure with the lowest energy. Energetically, both Se and Pt single vacancies prefer to combine to form double vacancies. All Se and Pt vacancies have remarkable influence on the electronic properties. Moreover, Pt single and double vacancies can introduce strong spin polarization in PtSe2, which may be promising for spintronic applications. These findings not only enrich the fundamental understanding of 1T-phase PtSe2 but also provide useful guidance to design PtSe2 for its optoelectronic and spintronic applications.","['A-Star, Institute of High Performance Computing', 'Northwestern Polytechnical University', 'National University of Singapore']","['China', 'Singapore']","['Hu X.', 'Zeng K.', 'Cheng Y.', 'Zhang G.', 'Tian T.', 'Gao J.', 'Zhang Y.-W.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,38,61.0,2017
Proposed Cesium-free Mineralization Method for Soil Decontamination: Demonstration of Cesium Removal from Weathered Biotite,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.The removal possibility of sorbed Cs from weathered biotite (WB), which is considered a major Cs adsorbent in the soil of Fukushima, has been investigated by the addition of an NaCl-CaCl2 mixed salt powder with a 1:1 ratio of Na and Ca and subsequent heat treatment under a reduced pressure of 14 Pa. X-ray fluorescence analysis was used to determine the Cs removal rate at elevated temperatures. The structural changes and new phases formed were determined using powder X-ray diffraction as well as electron diffraction and X-ray microanalysis in a transmission electron microscope. We found that Cs was completely removed from the specimen heated at 700 °C, where WB completely decomposed and augite was formed. On the basis of this finding, we propose the Cs-free mineralization method as a new soil-decontamination process in which Cs minerals are transformed by heating with certain additives into minerals that cannot incorporate Cs.","['The University of Tokyo', 'Japan Atomic Energy Agency']",['Japan'],"['Suzuki S.', 'Baba Y.', 'Shimoyama I.', 'Kogure T.', 'Honda M.', 'Yaita T.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,7,17.0,2017
Measuring and Predicting the Extraction Behavior of Biogenic Formic Acid in Biphasic Aqueous/Organic Reaction Mixtures,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.The distribution coefficients and selectivities required for extraction purposes were predicted with a thermodynamic equation of state for the ternary system formic acid/water/extraction solvent. These predictions were validated with experimental data from the literature and experimental data from the oxidation of biomass to formic acid process measured in this work. Extraction solvents discussed in this work are 1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-heptanol, 1-octanol, 1-decanol, ethyl n-butyl ether, diisopropyl ether, di-n-butyl ether, benzyl formate, and heptyl formate. The considered temperature ranged from 273 to 363 K under atmospheric pressure. Perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT) was used for prediction purposes applying an approach as simple as possible and as complex as necessary to achieve trustworthy data for selecting the best extraction solvent. Using PC-SAFT allowed identifying 1-hexanol as the most promising solvent out of the 11 extraction agents. The predicted data were in good agreement with the experimental distribution coefficients and the selectivities, which are very sensitive to experimental uncertainties.","['Technische Universität Dortmund', 'Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg']",['Germany'],"['Veith H.', 'Held C.', 'Albert J.', 'Voges M.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,12,50.0,2017

The magnetic moment is found to be reduced by ∼30% during the high resistance state (HRS) to low resistance state (LRS) switching. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results reveals an increase of the Cu+/Cu2+ oxidation state ratio (which has been determined by the relative positions of the Fermi level and the Cu acceptor level) during the HRS to LRS transition. This decreases the effective spin-polarized Cu2+-Vö-Cu+ channels and thus the magnetic moment. A conduction mechanism involving the formation of conductive filaments from the coupling of the CuM+ ions and Vö has been suggested.","['The University of Hong Kong', 'National University of Sciences and Technology Pakistan', 'Quaid-i-Azam University', 'Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology', 'HZDR - Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf']","['Hong Kong', 'Pakistan', 'Germany']","['Ling F.C.C.', 'Azad F.', 'Younas M.', 'Azeem W.', 'Arshad M.', 'Akhtar M.J.', 'Xu C.', 'Ho L.P.', 'Zhou S.', 'Su S.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,13,37.0,2017
Expedited route to fully substituted amino-pyrazole building blocks and their further transformations,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.We report here an efficient and easily reproducible two-step approach to heterocycle-substituted amino-pyrazoles from heterocyclic acetonitriles and their unprecedented subsequent transformations to fully substituted pyrazoles. Such transformations include regioselective derivatization from polyamino derivatives, formation of tetracyclic compounds in up to 45% overall yield, and deaminative transformations through diazotization, followed by arylation through Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling and C-H activation, providing arylated pyrazoles in up to 71% yield over four steps. This strategy allows the swift introduction of significant molecular complexity to a range of scaffolds.","['Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv', 'Université Fédérale Toulouse Midi-Pyrénées', 'Institute for Single Crystals']","['Ukraine', 'France']","['Mallet-Ladeira S.', 'Dyakonenko V.', 'Khilya O.', 'Gras E.', 'Kuleshova O.', 'Volovenko Y.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,5,51.0,2017
Structural Features and Ligand Selectivity for 10 Intermediates in the Activation Process of β2-Adrenergic Receptor,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.It has already been suggested by researchers that there should be multiple intermediate states in the activation process for G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). However, the intermediate states are very short-lived and hardly captured by the experiments, leading to very limited understanding of their structural features and drug efficacies. In this work, a novel joint strategy of targeted molecular dynamics simulation, conventional molecular dynamics simulation, and virtual screening is developed to address the problems. The results from 10 intermediate conformations obtained from the work reveal that the ligand pocket is very unstable and fluctuates between the inactive state and the active one in the case of ligand-free, in particular for ECL2 as a gate-keeper of the ligand-binding. The ligand-binding site could be stable in the active state with a small volume and a completely closed ECL2, only when the G-protein-binding region is fully activated. In addition, the activations of the ligand-binding pocket and G-protein-binding site are relatively independent and exhibit a loose allosteric coupling, which contributes to the existence of multiple intermediate conformations. Interestingly, the screening performance of the agonists does not increase on increasing the overall activity of the intermediate state, but is dependent on the activated extent of the ligand pocket. The receptor is prone to bind the agonist when closing ECL2 and reducing the ligand-binding pocket volume, whereas it is more favorable for binding the antagonist when opening ECL2 and increasing the pocket volume. These observations added to previous studies could help us better understand the activation mechanism of GPCRs and provide valuable information for drug design.","['Southwest University for Nationalities', 'Sichuan University']",['China'],"['Pu X.', 'Li C.', 'Yuan Y.', 'Li M.', 'Liang T.', 'Wang R.', 'Guo Y.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,4,77.0,2017
Synthesis of Fluoranthene Derivatives via Tandem Suzuki-Miyaura and Intramolecular C-H Arylation Reactions under Both Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Catalytic Conditions,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.A catalytic method for the synthesis of substituted fluoranthenes that operates via tandem Suzuki-Miyaura and intramolecular C-H arylation reactions is reported. The overall reaction sequence works effectively with homogeneous catalysis using Pd(dppf)Cl2 as well as heterogeneous catalysis using reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-CuPd nanocatalysts with low catalyst loadings. High functional group tolerance is observed under both catalytic conditions where arylboronic acids and esters having electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents afforded fluoranthene products in good yields (up to 78%). Moreover, the rGO-CuPd nanocatalysts are demonstrated to be reusable by preserving almost 90% of their initial activity after the third cycle.","['Atatürk Üniversitesi', 'Bilkent Üniversitesi']",['Turkey'],"['Turkmen Y.E.', 'Metin O.', 'Pal S.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,15,22.0,2017

Hard Carbon and Li4Ti5O12-Based Physically Mixed Anodes for Superior Li-Battery Performance with Significantly Reduced Li Content: A Case of Synergistic Materials Cooperation,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) and hard carbon (HC) are commonly used anodes in the Li-ion batteries. LTO has an operating voltage of 1.55 V and exhibits high-rate performance but with limited capacity. HC has high specific capacity but extremely low operating voltage. Herein, we show that a simple physical mixture of the two enhances the half-cell as well as full-cell performance through a synergistic cooperation between the materials. Specifically, the LTO-HC mixed anodes exhibit impressive performance even at high C-rates. This results from a quick internalization of Li ions by LTO followed by their distribution to HC regions via the high density of the winding internal interfaces between the two. The full cells of the LTO-HC mixed anodes with LiCoO2 (LCO) evince an enhanced operating voltage window and a well-defined plateau. Because of a reduced irreversible capacity loss in the LCO/mixed anode full cells, the overall specific capacity is better than the LCO/pristine anode full cells. Also, with the LTO-HC 20-80 anode (Li content reduced by 80%), the full cell exhibits an impressive performance when compared to pristine anodes without pre-lithiation. The LCO/mixed anode full cells have excellent cycling stability up to 500 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g-1.","['Centre for Energy Science', 'Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Pune']",['India'],"['Puthusseri D.', 'Sharma N.', 'Ogale S.', 'Thotiyl M.O.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,7,33.0,2017
Intramolecular Photoreactions of 9-Cyanophenanthrene-Linked Arylcyclopropanes,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.With the aim of developing efficient and useful processes for the preparation of polycyclic organic compounds, intramolecular [3 + 2] photoreactions of 9-cyanophenanthrene-linked arylcyclopropanes were investigated. Photoreactions of 6a,b, which contain respective p-methoxyphenylcyclopropane and phenylcyclopropane moieties, form the intramolecular [3 + 2] photocycloadducts, endo- and exo-7a,b, along with the dihydroisochroman derivatives, cis- and trans-8a,b. The efficiency of the photoreaction of 6a is higher when benzene rather than acetonitrile is used as a solvent. Interestingly, this solvent effect is reversed in the photoreaction of 6b, where the efficiency is higher in acetonitrile than that in benzene. On the basis of the observed effects of substituents and solvents, fluorescence emission from intramolecular exciplexes, and ΔGs for intramolecular single electron transfer (SET), we propose that the photoreactions proceed through pathways involving the initial formation of singlet intramolecular exciplexes and/or SET between the excited 9-cyanophenanthrene and the ground-state arylcyclopropane moieties.",['Kanazawa University'],['Japan'],"['Sakurai H.', 'Maeda H.', 'Segi M.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,4,24.0,2017
JRgui: A Python Program of Joback and Reid Method,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Using the modern object-oriented programing language Python (e.g., tkinter and pandas modules) and a chemoinformatics open-source library (RDKit), the classic Joback and Reid group contribution method was revisited and written into a graphical user interface program, JRgui. The underlying algorithm behind the program is explained, herein, with the users being able to operate the program in either a manual or automatic mode. In the manual mode, the users are required to determine the type and occurrence of functional groups in the compound of interest and manually enter into the program. In the automatic mode, both of these parameters can be detected automatically via user input of the compound simplified molecular input line entry specification (SMILES) string. An additional advantage of the automatic mode is that a large number of molecules can be processed simultaneously by parsing their individual SMILES strings into a text file, which is read by the program. The resulting predicted physical properties along with approximately 200 molecular descriptors are saved in a spreadsheet file for subsequent analysis. The program is available for free at https://github.com/curieshicy/JRgui for Windows, Linux, and macOS 64-bit operating systems.

Mutational Analysis of a Conserved Glutamate Reveals Unique Mechanistic and Structural Features of the Phosphatase PRL-3,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Phosphatase of regenerating liver (PRL)-3 (PTP4A3) has gained much attention in cancer research due to its involvement in tumor promoting and metastatic processes. It belongs to the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) superfamily and is thought to follow the catalytic mechanism shared by this family, which aside from the conserved active-site amino acids includes a conserved glutamic acid residue that is usually required for the integrity of the active site in PTPs. We noted that in structures of PRL-3, PRL-1, and PTEN these residues do not clearly align and therefore we sought to investigate if the glutamic acid residue fulfills its usual function in these proteins. Although this residue was essential for PTEN's catalytic activity, it was nonessential for PRL-1 and PRL-3. Surprisingly, the mutation E50R increased PRL-3 activity against all tested in vitro substrates and also enhanced PRL-3-promoted cell adhesion and migration. We show that the introduction of Arg50 leads to an enhancement of substrate turnover for both PRL-3 and, to a lesser extent, PRL-1, and that the stronger gain in activity correlates with a higher structural flexibility of PRL-3, likely allowing for conformational adaptation during catalysis. Thus, in contrast to its crucial functions in other PTPs, this conserved glutamic acid can be replaced in PRL-3 without impairing the structural integrity. The variant with enhanced activity might serve as a tool to study PRL-3 in the future.","['Universität Heidelberg', 'Universität Freiburg', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory Heidelberg']",['Germany'],"['Kohn M.', 'Rios P.', 'Duan G.', 'Hoeger B.', 'Berteotti A.', 'Hoermann B.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,4,45.0,2017
Anisotropic Nanoparticles Contributing to Shear-Thickening Behavior of Fumed Silica Suspensions,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Rheological characteristics of a concentrated suspension can be tuned using anisotropic particles having various shapes and sizes. Here, the role of anisotropic nanoparticles, such as surface-functionalized multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and graphene oxide nanoplatelets (GONPs), on the rheological behavior of fumed silica suspensions in poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is investigated. In these mixed-particle suspensions, the concentrations of MWNTs and GONPs are much lower than the fumed silica concentration. The suspensions are stable, and hydrogen-bonded PEG solvation layers around the particles inhibit their flocculation. Fumed silica suspensions over the concentration range considered here display shear-thickening behavior. However, for a larger concentration of MWNTs and with increasing aspect ratios, the shear-thickening behavior diminishes. In contrast, a distinct shear-thickening response has been observed for the GONP-containing suspensions for similar mass fractions (MFs) of MWNTs. For these suspensions, shear thickening is achieved at a lower solid MFs compared to the suspensions consisting of only fumed silica. A significant weight reduction of shear-thickening fluids that can be achieved by this approach is beneficial for many applications. Our results provide guiding principles for controlling the rheological behavior of mixed-particle systems relevant in many fields.","['Dave C.

Photo-Assisted Synthesis of a Pd-Ag@CQD Nanohybrid and Its Catalytic Efficiency in Promoting the Suzuki-Miyaura Cross-Coupling Reaction under Ligand-Free and Ambient Conditions,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Supported bimetallic nanoparticles are very promising heterogeneous catalysts for carbon-carbon cross-coupling reactions, though reports focusing on their synergistic activity for promoting such reactions are very limited. In the current study, bimetallic Pd-Ag hybrid nanoparticles supported on carbon quantum dots (CQDs), Pd-Ag@CQDs, were synthesized by a facile and fast UV-light-driven (365 nm) one-pot protocol for the first time to investigate such a synergistic activity. The physico-chemical structural features of the Pd-Ag@CQD nanohybrid were evaluated by UV-vis, Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction, electron-dispersive X-ray, and transmission electron microscopy analyses. The nanohybrid was found to have dimensions in the range of ca. 3-5 nm. The bimetallic Pd-Ag@CQD nanohybrid was utilized as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for promoting the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction with aryl bromides and aryl chlorides under ligand-free and ambient conditions. The synergistic activity of the components of the nanohybrid induced catalytic enhancement of the cross-coupling reaction in terms of short reaction times (<1 h) and high yields (>90%). The heterogeneous character of the nanohybrid system also enabled easy separation and recyclability (up to six cycles).",['Tezpur University'],['India'],"['Karak N.', 'Bayan R.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,41,30.0,2017
Supramolecular Peptide Nanofibers Engage Mechanisms of Autophagy in Antigen-Presenting Cells,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Supramolecular peptide nanofibers are attractive for applications in vaccine development due to their ability to induce strong immune responses without added adjuvants or associated inflammation. Here, we report that self-assembling peptide nanofibers bearing CD4+ or CD8+ T cell epitopes are processed through mechanisms of autophagy in antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Using standard in vitro antigen presentation assays, we confirmed loss and gain of the adjuvant function using pharmacological modulators of autophagy and APCs deficient in multiple autophagy proteins. The incorporation of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain-3 (LC3-II) into the autophagosomal membrane, a key biological marker for autophagy, was confirmed using microscopy. Our findings indicate that autophagy in APCs plays an essential role in the mechanism of adjuvant action of supramolecular peptide nanofibers.","['University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston', 'Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School at New Brunswick', 'Houston Methodist', 'The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston']",['United States'],"['Jagannath C.', 'Khan A.', 'Rudra J.S.', 'Zloza A.', 'Endsley J.J.', 'Wang J.', 'Clover T.M.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,15,32.0,2017
"Role of Biorelevant Dissolution Media in the Selection of Optimal Salt Forms of Oral Drugs: Maximizing the Gastrointestinal Solubility and in Vitro Activity of the Antimicrobial Molecule, Clofazimine","© 2017 American Chemical Society.Clofazimine is an antimycobacterial agent that is routinely used for the treatment of leprosy. Clofazimine has also been shown to have high clinical potential for the treatment of many Gram-positive pathogens, including those that exhibit high levels of antibiotic resistance in the medical community. The use of clofazimine against these pathogens has largely been limited by the inherently poor water solubility of the drug substance. In this work, the possibility of repurposing and reformulating clofazimine to maximize its clinical potential is investigated. To achieve this, the potential of novel salt forms of clofazimine as supersaturating drug-delivery vehicles to enhance the aqueous solubility and gastrointestinal solubility of the drug substance was explored. The solution properties of seven novel salt forms, identified during an initial screening process, were examined in water and in a gastrointestinal-like media and were compared and contrasted with those of the free base, clofazimine, and the commercial formulation of the drug, Lamprene. The stability of the most promising solid forms was tested, and their bioactivity against Staphylococcus aureus was also compared with that of the clofazimine free base and Lamprene.

Evaluating community engagement and benefit-sharing practices in Australian wind farm development,"© 2017 by the Regents of the University of California.The wind industry is positioned to contribute significantly to a clean energy future, yet the level of community opposition has at times led to unviable projects. Social acceptance is crucial and can be improved in part through better practice community engagement and benefit-sharing. This case study provides a “snapshot” of current community engagement and benefit-sharing practices for Australian wind farms, with a particular emphasis on practices found to be enhancing positive social outcomes in communities. Five methods were used to gather views on effective engagement and benefit-sharing: a literature review, interviews and a survey of the wind industry, a Delphi panel, and a review of community engagement plans. The overarching finding was that each community engagement and benefit-sharing initiative should be tailored to a community's context, needs and expectations as informed by community involvement. This requires moving away from a “one size fits all” approach. This case study is relevant to wind developers, energy regulators, local communities and renewable energy-focused non-government organizations. It is applicable beyond Australia to all contexts where wind farm development has encountered conflicted societal acceptance responses.","['Independent Communications Contractor', 'The University of Queensland', 'Embark', 'UNSW Sydney']",['Australia'],"['Hall N.L.', 'Wood E.', 'Lane T.', 'Hicks J.']",,Case Studies in the Environment,University of California Press,"['Education', 'Environmental Science (all)', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment']","['SOCI', 'ENVI', 'ENER']",Article,4,15.0,2017
Scalable Chitosan-Graphene Oxide Membranes: The Effect of GO Size on Properties and Cross-Flow Filtration Performance,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Chitosan (CS)-graphene oxide (GO) composite films were fabricated, characterized, and evaluated as pressure-driven water filtration membranes. GO particles were incorporated into a chitosan polymer solution to form a suspension that was cast as a membrane via evaporative phase inversion allowing for scale-up for cross-flow testing conditions. Morphology and composition results for nano and granular GO in the CS matrix indicate that the particle size of GO impacts the internal membrane morphology as well as the structural order and the chemical composition. Performance of the membranes was evaluated with cationic and anionic organic probe molecules and revealed charge-dependent mechanisms of dye removal. The CSGO membranes had rejections of at least 95% for cationic methylene blue with mass balances obtained from measurements of the feed, concentrate, and permeate. This result suggests the dominant mechanism of removal is physical rejection for both GO particle sizes. For anionic methyl orange, the results indicate sorption as the dominant mechanism of removal, and performance is dependent on both GO particle size and time, with micrometer-scale GO removing 68-99% and nanometer-scale GO showing modest removal of 29-64%. The pure water flux for CSGO composite membranes ranged from 2-4.5 L/m2 h at a transmembrane pressure of 344 kPa (3.44 bar), with pure water permeance ranging from 5.8 × 10-3 to 0.01 L/m2 h kPa (0.58-1.3 L/m2 h bar). Based on the 41 μm membrane thickness obtained from microscopy, the hydraulic permeability ranged from 0.24-0.54 L μm/m2 h kPa (24.4-54.1 L μm/m2 h bar).","['Stony Brook University', 'U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center', 'University of Arkansas']",['United States'],"['Nevins M.', 'Greenlee L.F.', 'Griggs C.S.', 'Gurtowski L.A.', 'Morgan T.A.', 'Mattei-Sosa J.A.', 'Medina V.F.', 'Abolhassani M.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,39,45.0,2017
Fluorinated Electrolytes for Li-Ion Batteries: The Lithium Difluoro(oxalato)borate Additive for Stabilizing the Solid Electrolyte Interphase,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Fluorinated electrolytes based on fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) have been considered as promising alternative electrolytes for high-voltage and high-energy capacity lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, the compatibility of the fluorinated electrolytes with graphite negative electrodes is unclear. In this paper, we have systematically investigated, for the first time, the stability of fluorinated electrolytes with graphite negative electrodes, and the result shows that unlike the ethylene carbonate (EC)-based electrolyte, the FEC-based electrolyte (EC was totally replaced by FEC) is incapable of forming a protective and effective solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that protects the electrolyte from runaway reduction on the graphite surface. The reason is that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels are also lowered by the introduction of fluorine into the solvent, and the FEC solvent has poorer resistance against reduction, leading to instability on the graphite negative electrode. To tackle this problem, two lithium salts of lithium bis(oxalato)borate and lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) have been investigated as negative-electrode film-forming additives. Incorporation of only 0.5 wt % LiDFOB to a FEC-based electrolyte [1.0 M LiPF6 in 3:7 (FEC-ethyl methyl carbonate)] results in excellent cycling performance of the graphite negative electrode. This improved property originates from the generation of a thinner and better quality SEI film with little LiF by the sacrificial reduction of the LiDFOB additive on the graphite negative electrode surface. On the other hand, this additive can stabilize the electrolyte by scavenging HF. Meanwhile, the incorporated LiDFOB additive has positive influence on the interphase layer on the positive electrode surface and significantly decreases the amount of HF formation, finally leading to improved cycling stability and rate capability of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 electrodes at a high cutoff voltage of 5 V. The data demonstrate that the LiDFOB additive not only exhibits a superior compatibility with graphite but also improves the electrochemical properties of high-voltage spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 positive electrodes considerably, confirming its potential as a prospective, multifunctional additive for 5 V fluorinated electrolytes in high-energy capacity lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).","['Ningbo Institute of Industrial Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'University of Nottingham Ningbo China']",['China'],"['Liu Z.', 'Lee S.', 'Chen G.Z.', 'Jiang Y.', 'Xia L.', 'Xia Y.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,51,49.0,2017
Firm's default — new methodological approach and preliminary evidence from Poland,"© 2017, Institute of Economic Research. All rights reserved.Research background:Bankruptcy literature is populated with scores of (econometric) models ranging from Altman’s Z-score, Ohlson’s O-score, Zmijewski’s probit model to k-nearest neighbors, classification trees, support vector machines, mathematical programming, evolutionary algorithms or neural networks, all designed to predict financial distress with highest precision. We believe corporate default is too an important research topic to be identified with the prediction accuracy only. Despite the wealth of modelling effort, a unified theory of default is yet to be proposed. Purpose of the article: Due to the disagreement both on the definition and hence the timing of default, as well as on the measurement of prediction accuracy, the comparison (of predictive power) of various models can be seriously misleading. The purpose of the article is to argue for the shift in research focus from maximizing accuracy to the analysis of the information capacity of predictors. By doing this, we may yet come closer to understanding default itself. Methods: We critically appraise the bankruptcy research literature for its methodological variety and empirical findings. Default definitions, sampling procedures, in and out-of-sample testing and accuracy measurement are all scrutinized. In an empirical part, we use a double stochastic Poisson process with multi-period prediction horizon and a comprehen-sive database of some 15,000 Polish non-listed companies to illustrate the merits of our new approach to default modelling. Findings & Value added: In the theoretical part, we call for the construction of a single unified default forecasting platform estimated for the largest dataset of firms possible to allow testing the utility of various sources of micro, mezzo, and macro information. Our preliminary empirical evidence is encouraging. The accuracy ratio amounts to 0.92 for t = 0 and drops to 0.81 two years ahead of default. We point to the pivotal role played by the information on firm’s liquidity (alternatively in profitability) and — in contrast to Altman’s tradition — hardly any contribution to predictive power of other financial ratios. Macro data is shown to be critical. It adds, on average, more than 10 p.p. to accuracy ratio. In the fu-ture, we hope to integrate listed and non-listed firms data into one model, ideally at higher frequency than annual, and include the information on firm's competitiveness position.","['Kozminski University', 'Szkola Glówna Handlowa w Warszawie']",['Poland'],"['Blawat B.', 'Dietl M.', 'Berent T.', 'Rejman R.', 'Krzyk P.']","['Bankruptcy', 'Default', 'Default probability', 'Informational capacity', 'Prediction accuracy']",Equilibrium.

Growth Inhibition and DNA Damage Induced by X-Phenols in Yeast: A Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship Study,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Phenolic compounds and their derivatives are ubiquitous constituents of numerous synthetic and natural chemicals that exist in the environment. Their toxicity is mostly attributed to their hydrophobicity and/or the formation of free radicals. In a continuation of the study of phenolic toxicity in a systematic manner, we have examined the biological responses of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to a series of mostly monosubstituted phenols utilizing a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) approach. The biological end points included a growth assay that determines the levels of growth inhibition induced by the phenols as well as a yeast deletion (DEL) assay that assesses the ability of X-phenols to induce DNA damage or DNA breaks. The QSAR analysis of cell growth patterns determined by IC50 and IC80 values indicates that toxicity is delineated by a hydrophobic, parabolic model. The DEL assay was then utilized to detect genomic deletions in yeast. The increase in the genotoxicity was enhanced by the electrophilicity of the phenolic substituents that were strong electron donors as well as by minimal hydrophobicity. The electrophilicities are represented by Brown's sigma plus values that are a variant of the Hammett sigma constants. A few mutant strains of genes involved in DNA repair were separately exposed to 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methyl-phenol (BHT) and butylated hydroxy anisole (BHA). They were subsequently screened for growth phenotypes.

Heterogeneous Route for the One-Pot Synthesis of N-Arylamides from Aldoximes and Aryl Halides Using the CuO/Carbon Material,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) stabilized by porous carbon materials (PCMs) are very promising for catalysis. In this work, monodispersed small and stable copper oxide (CuO) NPs were prepared with an average size of 10-20 nm without using any capping agent and then these NPs were encapsulated into porous carbon. The chemical and structural properties of the CuO/PCM material were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and nitrogen sorption. The obtained CuO/PCM nanocatalytic system has been used for the synthesis of N-arylamides from the reaction of aldoximes and aryl halides. Generally, copper(II) salt was used for the preparation of amides from aldoximes using some ligands and bases, but harsh reaction condition, stoichiometric amount of metal, and lack of recyclability limit their applications in industry. An alternative method is the use of heterogeneous catalysts. More importantly, these heterogeneous catalysts could be easily recycled and reused, showing potential application in organic synthesis.","['University of Calcutta', 'Indian Institute of Petroleum', 'University of Kalyani']",['India'],"['Islam S.M.', 'Islam M.M.', 'Singha Roy A.', 'Halder M.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,5,69.0,2017
Reflection of Molecular Twist in Unoccupied Molecular Orbitals in PTCDI Derivatives: A Density Functional Study,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.In this work, the structural and electronic properties of perylene tetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI) derivative molecules have been calculated using density functional theory simulations. Here, we have obtained the equilibrium geometry for certain PTCDI derivatives and calculated their occupied and unoccupied density of states separately for molecular orbitals lying in-plane (σ type) and orthogonal to the plane (π type) of the molecules. We have also simulated the X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) spectra for these molecules separately for π- and σ-type orbitals. A comparison between the unoccupied density of states and XAS data has been made because both provide a description of the molecular orbitals above the Fermi level. We have observed the presence of shallow-lying σ orbitals in twisted molecules and have obtained an almost linear relationship between the abundance of these orbitals and the degree of molecular twist. Additionally, we have shown the possibility of an experimentally viable stereoisomerism in PTCDI-C3.","['Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics', 'Baba Farid Institute of Technology', 'Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar Bihar University']",['India'],"['Mukherjee B.', 'Mukherjee M.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,3,61.0,2017
Thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA)-Carbon Dot/Aerogel Fluorescent Sensor for Lanthanide and Actinide Ions,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Contamination of groundwater with radioactive substances comprising actinides and lanthanides is a significant environmental hazard and thus the development of selective, sensitive, and easy-to-apply sensors for water-soluble actinide and lanthanide ions is highly sought. We constructed a new selective fluorescent sensor for UO22+, Sm3+, and Eu3+ based on a carbon dot (C-dot)-aerogel hybrid prepared through in situ carbonization of 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA), a high-affinity heavy metal chelator. The TTA-C-dot-aerogel enabled the detection of UO22+ ions, which induced a significant red fluorescence shift, whereas Eu3+ and particularly Sm3+ ions gave rise to pronounced fluorescence quenching. Importantly, the lanthanide/actinide ion-selective TTA-C-dots could be synthesized only in situ inside the aerogel pores, indicating the crucial role of the aerogel host matrix both in enabling the formation of the C-dots and in promoting the adsorption and interactions of the lanthanide and actinide metal ions with the embedded C-dots.","['Technion - Israel Institute of Technology', 'Nuclear Research Center-Negev', 'Ben-Gurion University of the Negev']",['Israel'],"['Jelinek R.', 'Zeiri L.', 'Bhunia S.K.', 'Paz-Tal O.', 'Dolai S.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,27,50.0,2017
Oxytocin-Monolayer-Based Impedimetric Biosensor for Zinc and Copper Ions,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Zinc and copper are essential metal ions for numerous biological processes. Their levels are tightly maintained in all body organs. Impairment of the Zn2+ to Cu2+ ratio in serum was found to correlate with many disease states, including immunological and inflammatory disorders. Oxytocin (OT) is a neuropeptide, and its activity is modulated by zinc and copper ion binding. Harnessing the intrinsic properties of OT is one of the attractive ways to develop valuable metal ion sensors. Here, we report for the first time an OT-based metal ion sensor prepared by immobilizing the neuropeptide onto a glassy carbon electrode. The developed impedimetric biosensor was ultrasensitive to Zn2+ and Cu2+ ions at physiological pH and not to other biologically relevant ions. Interestingly, the electrochemical impedance signal of two hemicircle systems was recorded after the attachment of OT to the surface. These two semicircles suggest two capacitive regions that result from two different domains in the OT monolayer. Moreover, the change in the charge-transfer resistance of either Zn2+ or Cu2+ was not similar in response to binding. This suggests that the metal-dependent conformational changes of OT can be translated to distinct impedimetric data. Selective masking of Zn2+ and Cu2+ was used to allow for the simultaneous determination of zinc to copper ions ratio by the OT sensor. The OT sensor was able to distinguish between healthy control and multiple sclerosis patients diluted sera samples by determining the Zn/Cu ratio similar to the state-of-the-art techniques. The OT sensor presented herein is likely to have numerous applications in biomedical research and pave the way to other types of neuropeptide-derived sensors.","['MX Biotech Ltd.', 'Hadassah University Medical Centre', 'Hebrew University of Jerusalem']",['Israel'],"['Dimitrios K.M.', 'Gilon C.', 'Mervinetsky E.', 'Hurevich M.', 'Petrou P.', 'Alshanski I.', 'Tadi K.K.', 'Yitzchaik S.', 'Marx G.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,20,63.0,2017

Graphene-Coupled ZnO: A Robust NIR-Induced Catalyst for Rapid Photo-Oxidation of Cyanide,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Herein, we report the modulation of ZnO for enhancement of its ability toward plasmonic absorption of near-infrared (NIR) photons through coupling of graphene (GR). The reported modification led GR-ZnO to be a promising photocatalyst by the complete removal of poisonous and nonvolatile potassium cyanide from water. The photocatalytic degradation of cyanide was revealed by exposing it to NIR laser and comparing with the rate of UV, visible, and sunlight using their apparent reaction rate constants derived from the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. The heteronanostructured GR-ZnO promoted rapid photo-oxidation of cyanide under illumination with NIR laser rather than UV, visible, and sunlight. It was assessed that the photothermal effect (PTE) is the main cause for higher catalytic efficiency of GR-ZnO in the presence of NIR radiations. Except for the NIR radiations, GR-ZnO does not show any indication of PTE by irradiating with UV, visible, or sunlight. On account of its significance, the PTE of GR-ZnO in KCN solution was evaluated and compared with its individual components viz., GR and ZnO upon exposure to a 980 nm laser system. Furthermore, it has been revealed that the PTE of GR-ZnO was proportional to its concentration. In addition to its effectiveness in the degradation of cyanide, GR-ZnO retained its special structure and exhibited an outstanding photostability after its repeated use in three successive cycles.",['Prairie View A&amp;M University'],['United States'],"['Oki A.', 'Neelgund G.M.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,26,27.0,2017
Evolution of Calcite Nanocrystals through Oriented Attachment and Fragmentation: Multistep Pathway Involving Bottom-Up and Break-Down Stages,© 2017 American Chemical Society.A nonclassical multistep pathway involving bottom-up and break-down stages for the evolution of calcite nanograins ∼50 nm in size was demonstrated in a basic aqueous system. Calcite nanofibrils ∼10 nm wide were produced as the initial crystalline phase via amorphous calcium carbonate through ion-by-ion assembly by the carbonation of Ca(OH)2 at a high pH of ∼13. Bundles ∼50 nm in diameter were then formed by the subsequent oriented attachment of the nanofibrils.

The impact of global risk on the performance of socially responsible and conventional stock indices,"© 2017, Institute of Economic Research. All rights reserved.Research background:In the last decades social responsible investment has evolved into an important and influential investment class. What supports then the development of SRI? The neoclassical approach suggests that the attractiveness of investment should result from the risk-return relationship that is satisfying for the investor. However, the performance analysis of SRI vs. conventional investment, conducted in numerous research papers, often delivers contradictory conclusions. If financial factors could not explain the phenomenon of SRI, nonfinancial factors may have played a decisive role in the formation of modern SRI market. Purpose of the article: The purpose of this paper is to analyze financial investment performance of socially responsible vs. respective conventional indices in the periods of high, low and unidentified global risk. Therefore, a following research hypothesis was verified: SR indices perform financially better in high-risk periods than in low-risk periods. This hypothesis is justified by the assumption that, when selecting SRI, investors go by a longer investment horizon than they do when selecting other investments, not subject to such verification. Methods: Among SR indices, we chose three to compare them with their conventional counterparts: DJSI US vs. DJITR (USA), DJSI Korea vs. KOSPI (South Korea) and Respect Index vs. WIG20TR (Poland). The VIX index was used as the global measure of risk aversion. To measure the relative performance of SR and conventional indices in different risk periods, we applied risk-adjusted performance measures, including RSD, Sharpe and Treynor ratios, traditional and asymmetrical CAPM. Findings & Value added: The research shows that conventional and socially responsible indices do not differ statistically in terms of risk and return irrespective of global risk. Our research confirms that the rising, socially responsible, investment market cannot be analyzed only through the prism of simplified rational choices. Additionally, it should be analyzed in terms of moral philosophy and behavioral economics, including the psycho-social features of investors.",['Poznań University of Economics and Business'],['Poland'],"['Lobza M.', 'Sliwinski P.']","['Financial global risk', 'Investment performance', 'Socially responsible indices', 'Socially responsible investments (SRI)', 'VIX']",Equilibrium.

Luminescent Iridium(III) Chemosensor for Tandem Detection of F- and Al3+,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.A new highly sensitive luminescent iridium(III) chemosensor, 1, was designed and synthesized for tandem detection of fluoride ions (F-) and aluminum ions (Al3+). This sensor 1 exhibited obvious luminesce quenching by hydrogen bond interactions with F-. In addition, the resulting 1-F complex can be further used to detect Al3+ through a luminesce enhancement. The detection limit (0.02 μM) of 1-F for Al3+ is far lower than the World Health Organization (7.41 μM) limit for drinking water. Importantly, chemosensor 1-F could be used to detect and quantify F- and Al3+ reversibly.

Economic growth and disparities: An empirical analysis for the central and eastern European countries,"© 2017, Institute of Economic Research. All rights reserved.Research background:The processes of economic convergence observed in many developing countries are characterized by reduction of economic differences on the cross-country level, which are accompanied by growing internal economic inequalities. This may stem from the fact that in the catching-up countries, a more dynamic growth pattern is observed in the economically strongest regions, which is initially reflected in spatial polarization and increasing regional inequalities. However, just as the countries reach higher levels of development, the diffusion of growth-inducing impulses to less-developed areas should lead to the spatial equalizing of the development levels and reducing regional inequalities. Purpose of the article: The aim of the paper is to determine the relationship between the level of economic growth and observed economic inequalities in Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. The theoretical framework adopted to describe and explain those relations is the so-called Williamson’s hypothesis in which the relationship between the scale of regional inequalities and economic growth is illustrated by a curve shaped like an inverted U. Methods: The research procedure was intended to verify Williamson’s hypothesis by estimating parabolic econometric models. Indicators of economic growth along with measure of regional inequalities (Williamson’s coefficient of variation) were used in the regression modeling. The research period spanned the years 1995-2014. Findings & Value added: In the light of the study of CEE countries, it was possible to observe both convergence symptoms as well as divergence tendencies. It can be thus stated that the analyzed CEE countries followed a similar path to the one observed earlier by Williamson in other developing countries. However, the analyses conducted by the authors at the national and regional levels of CEE countries were equivocal and did not fully support the theoretical assumptions of Williamson’s hypothesis.",['Poznań University of Economics and Business'],['Poland'],"['Kisiala W.', 'Suszynska K.']","['Central and Eastern Europe', 'Econometric modeling', 'Economic growth', 'Regional inequalities', 'Williamson’s hypothesis']",Equilibrium.

Nanosized Gadolinium and Uranium - Two Representatives of High-Reactivity Lanthanide and Actinide Metal Nanoparticles,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Gadolinium (Gd0) and uranium (U0) nanoparticles are prepared via lithium naphthalenide ([LiNaph])-driven reduction in tetrahydrofuran (THF) using GdCl3 and UCl4, respectively, as low-cost starting materials. The as-prepared Gd0 and U0 suspensions are colloidally stable and contain metal nanoparticles with diameters of 2.5 ± 0.7 nm (Gd0) and 2.0 ± 0.5 nm (U0). Whereas THF suspensions are chemically stable under inert conditions (Ar and vacuum), nanoparticulate powder samples show high reactivity in contact with, for example, oxygen, moisture, alcohols, or halogens.

Low-Temperature and Solution-Processable Zinc Oxide Transistors for Transparent Electronics,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Zinc oxide (ZnO) thin-film transistors (TFTs) have many promising applications in the areas of logic circuits, displays, ultraviolet detectors, and biosensors due to their high performances, facile fabrication processing, and low cost. The solution method is an important technique for low-cost and large fabrication of oxide semiconductor TFTs. However, a key challenge of solution-processable ZnO TFTs is the relatively high processing temperature (≥500 °C) for achieving high carrier mobility. Here, facile, low-cost, and solution-processable ZnO TFTs were fabricated under the annealing temperature of ≤300 °C. Dense and polycrystalline ZnO films were deposited by the spin-coating method. The ZnO TFTs showed the maximum electron mobility of 11 cm2/V s and a high on/off ratio of >107 when the ZnO thin films were annealed at 300 °C. The mobility was extremely high among solution-processable undoped ZnO TFTs reported previously, even better than some high-cost indium-doped ZnO TFTs fabricated at low temperature. Furthermore, it is found that the mechanism of oxygen vacancies dominates the electron transport in ZnO thin film and interface behaviors of ZnO thin film and SiO2 gate insulator, and then dominates the performances of devices.","['Hubei University', 'Wuhan University of Technology']",['China'],"['Zhang L.', 'Huang K.', 'Sun Z.', 'Wang X.', 'Li S.', 'Wang Q.', 'Mei T.', 'Jiang L.', 'Wang J.', 'Wang N.', 'Li J.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,46,32.0,2017

Supramolecular Dye Aggregate Assembly Enables Ratiometric Detection and Discrimination of Lysine and Arginine in Aqueous Solution,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Constructing sensor systems for rapid and selective detection of small biomolecules such as amino acids is a major area of focus in bioanalytical chemistry. Considering the biological relevance of arginine and lysine, significant efforts have been directed to develop fluorescent sensors for their detection. However, these developed sensors suffer from certain disadvantages such as poor aqueous solubility, technically demanding and time-consuming synthetic protocols, and more importantly, most of them operate through single wavelength measurements, making their performance prone to small variations in experimental conditions. Herein, we report a ratiometric sensor that operates through lysine- and arginine-induced dissociation of a supramolecular assembly consisting of emissive H-aggregates of a molecular rotor dye, thioflavin-T (ThT), on the surface of a polyanionic supramolecular host, sulfated β-cyclodextrin. This disassembly brings out the modulation of monomer-aggregate equilibrium in the system which acts as an ideal scheme for the ratiometric detection of lysine and arginine in the aqueous solution. Besides facile framework of our sensor system, it employs a commercially available inexpensive probe molecule, ThT, which provides an added advantage over other sensor systems that employ synthetically demanding probe molecules. Importantly, the distinctive feature of the ratiometric detection of arginine and lysine provides an inherent advantage of increased accuracy in quantitative analysis. Interestingly, we have also demonstrated that arginine displays a multiwavelength distinctive recognition pattern which distinguishes it from lysine, using a single supramolecular ensemble. Furthermore, our sensor system also shows response in heterogeneous, biologically complex media of serum samples, thus extending its possible use in real-life applications.","['Homi Bhabha National Institute', 'Bhabha Atomic Research Centre']",['India'],"['Singh P.K.', 'Pettiwala A.M.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,45,55.0,2017

Monodispersed Ru Nanoparticles Functionalized Graphene Nanosheets as Efficient Cathode Catalysts for O2-Assisted Li-CO2 Battery,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.In Li-CO2 battery, due to the highly insulating nature of the discharge product of Li2CO3, the battery needs to be charged at a high charge overpotential, leading to severe cathode and electrolyte instability and hence poor battery cycle performance. Developing efficient cathode catalysts to effectively reduce the charge overpotential represents one of key challenges to realize practical Li-CO2 batteries. Here, we report the use of monodispersed Ru nanoparticles functionalized graphene nanosheets as cathode catalysts in Li-CO2 battery to significantly lower the charge overpotential for the electrochemical decomposition of Li2CO3. In our battery, a low charge voltage of 4.02 V, a high Coulomb efficiency of 89.2%, and a good cycle stability (67 cycles at a 500 mA h/g limited capacity) are achieved. It is also found that O2 plays an essential role in the discharge process of the rechargeable Li-CO2 battery. Under the pure CO2 environment, Li-CO2 battery exhibits negligible discharge capacity; however, after introducing 2% O2 (volume ratio) into CO2, the O2-assisted Li-CO2 battery can deliver a high capacity of 4742 mA h/g. Through an in situ quantitative differential electrochemical mass spectrometry investigation, the final discharge product Li2CO3 is proposed to form via the reaction 4Li+ + 2CO2 + O2 + 4e- → 2Li2CO3. Our results validate the essential role of O2 and can help deepen the understanding of the discharge and charge reaction mechanisms of the Li-CO2 battery.","['Changchun Institute Of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy Of Sciences', 'Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore', 'Nanjing University of Information Science &amp; Technology', 'National University of Singapore', 'School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences']","['China', 'Singapore']","['Ma L.', 'Dai W.', 'Wang L.', 'Lin M.', 'Zhou Y.', 'Liu J.', 'Chen W.', 'Lai M.', 'Gong L.', 'Peng Z.', 'Lyu Z.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,61,39.0,2017
Production and Characterization of Polyhydroxyalkanoate from Lignin Derivatives by Pandoraea sp. ISTKB,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.The present study investigates polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production from lignin and its derivatives by a previously reported lignin-degrading bacterial strain Pandoraea sp. ISTKB. PHA production was screened by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry using a Nile red stain. PHA and biomass accumulation, while screening, was found to be maximum on 4-hydroxybenzoic acid followed by p-coumaric acid, vanillic acid, 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, and kraft lignin after 96 h. Monomer composition was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and was followed by Fourier transform infrared and 1H NMR analysis, indicating PHA to be a copolymer of P(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate). Genomic analysis of Pandoraea sp. ISTKB also complemented the results of GC-MS and NMR, and the relevant genes responsible for the synthesis of small chain length PHA were discovered in the genome. Process parameters were optimized by response surface methodology for enhanced production of PHA and biomass on 4-hydroxybenzoate. Optimization results showed 30 and 66% increase in the biomass and PHA production, respectively. The results obtained were promising and indicated that if lignin is depolymerized into low-molecular-weight intermediates, then it can easily be utilized and converted into value-added products like PHA by microbes.","['National Institute for Plant Genome Research India', 'Jawaharlal Nehru University']",['India'],"['Verma P.K.', 'Singhal A.', 'Thakur I.S.', 'Kumar M.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,83,32.0,2017
Fluorophenylazocarboxylates: Design and Synthesis of Potential Radioligands for Dopamine D3 and μ-Opioid Receptor,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.18F-Labeled building blocks from the type of [18F]fluorophenylazocarboxylic-tert-butyl esters offer a rapid, mild, and reliable method for the 18F-fluoroarylation of biomolecules. Two series of azocarboxamides were synthesized as potential radioligands for dopamine D3 and the μ-opioid receptor, revealing compounds 3d and 3e with single-digit and sub-nanomolar affinity for the D3 receptor and compound 4c with only micromolar affinity for the μ-opioid receptor, but enhanced selectivity for the μ-subtype in comparison to the lead compound AH-7921. A ""minimalist procedure"" without the use of a cryptand and base for the preparation of 4-[18F]fluorophenylazocarboxylic-tert-butyl ester [18F]2a was established, together with the radiosynthesis of methyl-, methoxy-, and phenyl-substituted derivatives ([18F]2b-f). With the substituted [18F]fluorophenylazocarbylates in hand, two prototype azocarboxylates radioligands were synthesized by 18F-fluoroarylation, namely the methoxy azocarboxamide [18F]3d as the D3 receptor radioligand and [18F]4a as a prototype structure of the μ-opioid receptor radioligand. By introducing the new series of [18F]fluorophenylazocarboxylic-tert-butyl esters, the method of 18F-fluoroarylation was significantly expanded, thereby demonstrating the versatility of 18F-labeled phenylazocarboxylates for the design of potential radiotracers for positron emission tomography.",['Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg'],['Germany'],"['Rampp H.', 'Hubner H.', 'Nebel N.', 'Lasch R.', 'Strauch B.', 'Bock L.R.', 'Fehler S.K.', 'Gmeiner P.', 'Heinrich M.R.', 'Prante O.', 'Maschauer S.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,11,44.0,2017
Logit and probit application for the prediction of bankruptcy in slovak companies,"© 2017, Institute of Economic Research. All rights reserved.Research background:Prediction of bankruptcy is an issue of interest of various researchers and practitioners since the first study dedicated to this topic was published in 1932. Finding the suitable bankruptcy prediction model is the task for economists and analysts from all over the world. forecasting model using. Despite a large number of various models, which have been created by using different methods with the aim to achieve the best results, it is still challenging to predict bankruptcy risk, as corporations have become more global and more complex. Purpose of the article: The aim of the presented study is to construct, via an empirical study of relevant literature and application of suitable chosen mathematical statistical methods, models for bankruptcy prediction of Slovak companies and provide the comparison of overall prediction ability of the two developed models. Methods: The research was conducted on the data set of Slovak corporations covering the period of the year 2015, and two mathematical statistical methods were applied. The methods are logit and probit, which are both symmetric binary choice models, also known as conditional probability models. On the other hand, these methods show some significant differences in process of model formation, as well as in achieved results. Findings & Value added: Given the fact that mostly discriminant analysis and logistic regression are used for the construction of bankruptcy prediction models, we have focused our attention on the development bankruptcy prediction model in the Slovak Republic via logistic regression and probit. The results of the study suggest that the model based on a logit functions slightly outperforms the classification accuracy of probit model.

"Cultural, political and economic roots of the labor market institutional framework in the oecd and post-socialist countries","© 2017, Institute of Economic Research. All rights reserved.Research background:The literature indicates that labor market institutions are determined by cultural, political and economic factors, but does not give explicit conclusions which of these vast group of factors dominates. Purpose of the article: The goal of this study is to empirically assess whether cultural and political factors dominate over economic factors in shaping the labor market institutional framework in the OECD and post-socialist countries. Methods: This framework can be measured by a vast group of indicators. We use 10 such variables that describe the group of 47 post-socialist and OECD countries (that did not experience economic transition) in the years 2005–2009. These indicators allow to construct one Employment Efficiency Index which explains almost 47% of the employment rate heterogeneity in the years 2010–2015. In the second step, the Employment Efficiency Index is regressed on 7 uncorrelated and standardized components that describe the cultural, political and economic characteristics of the analyzed countries in the years 1995–2004 and the Chow test is conducted in order to determine whether they influence the Index with the same strength in post-socialist and non-transition OECD countries. Findings & Value added: The obtained results show that cultural and political factors have a stronger influence on labor market institutions. Moreover, the estimates reveal that the countries which experienced weak labor market performance in the period 1995–2004 did not make their institutional framework more pro-employment in the following years and, in consequence, also recorded low values of the employment rate in the period 2010–2015. Such result suggests that economic factors occurred to be on average an insufficient trigger for labor market reforms in the group of analyzed countries. Finally, the Chow test revealed that this conclusion is applicable to both post-socialist and non-transition OECD countries.",['Poznań University of Economics and Business'],['Poland'],['Pilc M.'],"['Employment level', 'Labor market institutions', 'Labor market policy', 'Political economy', 'Post-socialist countries']",Equilibrium.

Detection of Organochlorine Pesticides in Contaminated Marine Environments via Cyclodextrin-Promoted Fluorescence Modulation,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.The development of practical and robust detection methods for pesticides is an important research objective owing to the known toxicity, carcinogenicity, and environmental persistence of these compounds. Pesticides have been found in bodies of water that are located near areas where pesticides are commonly used and easily spread to beaches, lakes, and rivers; affect the species living in those waterways; and harm humans who come into contact with or eat fish from such water. Reported herein is the rapid, sensitive, and selective detection of four organochlorine pesticides in a variety of water sources across the state of Rhode Island using cyclodextrin-promoted fluorescence detection. This method relies on the ability of cyclodextrin to promote analyte-specific fluorescence modulation of a high quantum yield fluorophore when a pesticide is in close proximity, combined with subsequent array-based statistical analyses of the measurable changes in the emission signals. This system operates with high sensitivity (low micromolar detection limits), selectivity (100% differentiation between structurally similar analytes), and general applicability (for different water samples with varying salinity and pH as well as for different water temperatures).",['The University of Rhode Island'],['United States'],"['Miller J.', 'Discenza D.J.', 'Levine M.', 'Lynch J.', 'Verderame M.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,21,82.0,2017
Structural transformation and economic development in the best performing sub-saharan african states,"© 2017, Institute of Economic Research. All rights reserved.Research background:Economic development in sub-Saharan Africa is of paramount importance, yet it escapes most of the attempts to understand it better in the economic discourse, and it remains a sensitive issue in politics, contradicting stakeholders at national and international levels. The region still lags behind others in terms of technological advancement and economic development. It has grown significantly in the precedent decade, but the extent of growth has not sufficiently translated to its development. Determining strategies for sub-Saharan Africa is a scientific challenge, which requires more attention. In the globalized, interconnected reality, solving problems of the South is in the best interest of the North. Purpose of the article: The aim of this research is to analyze structural changes as factors of economic development in the best performing sub-Saharan African countries on the grounds of new structural economics in order to provide policy implications. Methods: Namibia, Botswana, South Africa and Gabon were selected as best performing economies in the region. Based on the literature review and the analysis of descriptive statistics, profiles of sample countries were set. This in turn allowed to determine the potential explanatory variables for OLS model of economic development. In the model, factors relating to labour productivity, technology and structural change were included.

National intellectual capital influence on economic growth in the European Union countries,"© 2017, Institute of Economic Research. All rights reserved.Research background:Importance of intangible resources for country’s economic growth is widely recognized. However, empirical evidence of this influence is hard to show due to measurement limitations of intangible resources. Majority of empirical studies concentrates on the analysis of a specific type of intangible resource’s influence on economic growth. National intellectual capital concept provides background for an integrated assessment of the country's intangible resources. This new approach enables the estimation of intangible resources’ influence to economic growth in a more complex way. Purpose of the article: a) To examine various scientific approaches of the national intellectual capital and its impact on the economic growth; b) to offer a measurement model of the national intellectual capital influence on economic growth; c) to evaluate the specific European Union countries’ intellectual capital’s effect on their economic growth. Methods: Econometric analysis; refined factor value computation method using the stand-ardized regression coefficients; the SAW method; expert evaluation, cluster analysis; correlation and regression analyses. Findings & Value added: A review of the economic growth theories showed that structural components of intellectual capital (human capital, structural capital, social capital, relational capital) in economic growth theories are analyzed as key determinants of economic growth. Our proposed research methodology consists time lag between variables and this let us evaluate casual relation. Empirical analysis of 25 European Union countries’ intellectual capital’s effect on their economic growth rate revealed that national intellectual capital and the countries’ level of economic development have statistically significant impact on economic growth rate. The analysis of intellectual capital components’ influence on economic growth rate of 25 European Union countries showed that only human capital and the level of economic development have statistically significant influence. A more comprehensive human capital’s influence on economic growth analysis revealed that 63.1 percent of the long-term economic growth rate in 25 European Union countries can be explained by differences in their economic development level and differences in educational achievement factor values. Moreover, analysis of national intellectual capital effect on economic growth in separate clusters allowed to identify influence differences in each group of countries.",['Mykolas Romeris University'],['Lithuania'],"['Macerinskiene I.', 'Aleknaviciute R.']","['Economic growth', 'Human capital', 'National intellectual capital', 'Relational capital', 'Social capital', 'Structural capital']",Equilibrium.

PH-Regulated synthesis of trypsin-templated copper nanoclusters with blue and yellow fluorescent emission,"© 2017 American Chemical SocietyIn this article, a simple protocol to prepare water-soluble fluorescent copper nanoclusters (CuNCs) using trypsin as a stabilizer and hydrazine hydrate as a reducing agent was reported. It was found that the pH of the reaction solution was critical in determining the fluorescence of CuNCs. CuNCs with blue and yellow fluorescent emission were obtained under basic and acidic conditions, respectively. Although the detailed formation mechanisms of these CuNCs required further analysis, the synthetic route was promising for preparing different fluorescent metal NCs for applications. With good water solubility and excellent photostability, the yellow-emitting CuNCs could serve as a fluorescence probe for detection of Hg2+ based on the aggregation-induced quenching mechanism. The fluorescence quenching efficiency had fantastic linearity to Hg2+ concentrations in the range of 0.1−100 μM, with a limit of detection of 30 nM. Additionally, the yellow-emitting CuNCs exhibited negligible cytotoxicity and were successfully applied to bioimaging of HeLa cells.","['Lanzhou University', 'State Key Laboratory of Applied Organic Chemistry']",['China'],"['Feng J.', 'Ma S.', 'Zhang H.', 'Liu J.', 'Chen X.', 'Han Y.', 'Chen Y.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,43,62.0,2017

The temperature-responsive behavior of the resulting gels was characterized by swelling studies, and the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the hydrogels was characterized through differential scanning calorimetry. Increased content of 44BDA led to a decreased swelling ratio and shifted the LCST to lower temperatures.

Effect of mixed valence states of platinum ion dopants on the photocatalytic activity of titanium dioxide under visible light irradiation,"© 2017 American Chemical SocietyTitanium dioxide doped with the Pt ion (Pt− TiO2) was synthesized by a sol−gel method using only water as the solvent and conducting dialysis. The photocatalytic activity for the degradation of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) on Pt− TiO2 was not affected by the Brunauer−Emmett−Teller specific surface area under visible light (VL) irradiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure measurements revealed that only the Pt(IV) ion existed in the TiO2 bulk and both Pt(II) and Pt(IV) were present near the Pt−TiO2 surface. Pt(IV) is most likely substituted in the Ti(IV) site of the TiO2 lattice because of their similar ionic sizes. Quantitative analysis of Pt(II) was performed in the XPS measurements, indicating that the amount of Pt(II) on the surface increased with an increase in the doping amount from 0.2 to 1.0 atom %. We synthesized 0.5 atom % Pt−TiO2 with various Pt(II)/Pt(IV) ratios by changing the Ti(OC3H7)4 concentration used in the sol−gel synthesis. The 4-CP conversion on Pt−TiO2 increased linearly with an increase in the Pt(II)/Pt(IV) ratios. A similar relationship was obtained with Pt−TiO2, which was prepared by a conventional sol−gel method in ethanol−water mixed solvent. Therefore, the Pt(II)/Pt(IV) ratio is a key factor affecting the photocatalytic activity of Pt−TiO2 under VL irradiation. Our results indicate that controlling the mixed valence states of the doped metal ions is a new strategy to developing highly active metal-ion-doped TiO2 under VL irradiation.","['Yamaguchi University', 'Graduate School of Science and Engineering']","['United States', 'Japan']","['Nishiyama N.', 'Yamazaki S.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,16,31.0,2017
Effect of differential self-assembly on mechanochromic luminescence of fluorene-benzothiadiazole-based fluorophores,"© 2017 American Chemical SocietySupramolecular self-assembly is an excellent tool for controlling the optical and electronic properties of chromophore-based molecular systems.

We have synthesized two donor−acceptor− donor-type conjugated oligomers consisting of fluorene as the donor and benzothiadiazole as the acceptor. For facile self-assembly, both molecules are end-functionalized with hydrogen-bonding amide groups. Differential self-assembly was induced by attaching alkyl chains of different lengths onto the fluorene moiety: hexyl (FB-C6) and dodecyl (FB-C12). The molecules self-assemble to form well-defined nanostructures in nonpolar solvents and solvent mixtures. Although their optical properties in solution are not affected by the alkyl chain length, significant effects were observed in the self-assembled state, particularly in the excitation energy migration properties. As a result, remarkable differences were observed in the mechanochromic luminescence properties of the molecules. A precise structure− property correlation is made using UV−visible absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy time-correlated single-photon counting analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy.","['National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology', 'Photosciences and Photonics Section']","['India', 'United States']","['Naeem K.C.', 'Neenu K.', 'Nair V.C.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,16,63.0,2017
Anion complexation studies of 3‑nitrophenyl-substituted tripodal thiourea receptor: A naked-eye detection of sulfate via fluoride displacement assay,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.A thiourea-based tripodal receptor L substituted with 3-nitrophenyl groups has been synthesized, and the binding affinity for a variety of anions has been studied by1H NMR titrations and nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy experiments in dimethyl sulfoxide-d6. As investigated by1H NMR titrations, the receptor binds an anion in a 1:1 binding mode, showing the highest binding and strong selectivity for sulfate anion. A competitive colorimetric assay in the presence of fluoride suggests that the sulfate is capable of displacing the bound fluoride, showing a sharp visible color change. The strong affinity of L for sulfate was further supported by UV−vis titrations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Time-dependent DFT calculations indicate that the fluoride complex possesses a different optical absorption spectrum (due to charge transfer between the fluoride and the surrounding ligand) than the sulfate complex, reflecting the observed colorimetric change in these two complexes. The receptor was further tested for its biocompatibility on primary human foreskin fibroblasts and HeLa cells, exhibiting an excellent cell viability up to 100 μM concentration.","['University of California, Riverside', 'The University of Oklahoma', 'Jackson State University', 'University of Mississippi Medical Center']",['United States'],"['Powell D.R.', 'Johnson C.R.', 'Hossain A.', 'Williams N.A.', 'Khansari M.E.', 'Wong B.M.', 'Hasan M.H.', 'Tandon R.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,19,40.0,2017
Macroporous gel with a permeable reaction platform for catalytic flow synthesis,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.We mimic a living system wherein target molecules permeate through capillary and cells for chemical transformation. A monolithic porous gel (MPG) was easily prepared by copolymerization of gel matrix, tertiary amine, and cross-linking monomer in one-step synthesis. Interconnected capillaries existed in the MPG, enabling flow application with high permeability. Because the capillaries were constituted of polymer gel, Pd(0)-loaded MPG provided another permeable pathway to substrates in a gel network, contributing to its much high turnover number after 30 days of use, compared with that of Pd(0)-loaded inorganic supports. Interestingly, the gel network size of the MPG influenced the catalytic frequency. Diffusivities of the substrates and product in the gel networks increased with increasing network sizes in relation to catalytic activities. The MPG strategy provides a universal reactor design in conjunction with a practical process and precisely controlled reaction platform.","['Fukuoka University', 'Kyushu University']",['Japan'],"['Miura Y.', 'Hoshino Y.', 'Matsumoto H.', 'Akiyoshi T.', 'Shibuya M.', 'Seto H.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,17,45.0,2017
CDS QDs-decorated self-doped γ‑Bi2MoO6: A sustainable and versatile photocatalyst toward photoreduction of Cr(VI) and degradation of phenol,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.In this work, CdS quantum dots (QDs)-sensitized self-doped Bi2MoO6 has been synthesized using glucose as reducing agent by hydrothermal method, followed by in situ deposition of the QDs. The synthesized catalyst has been employed to reduce toxic Cr(VI) and degrade phenol from the aqueous solution. The structural, optical, and electrochemical characterizations are performed using X-ray diffraction, UV−vis diffuse reflection, photoluminescence (PL), scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The optical properties were precisely investigated by calculating the Urbach energy, PL, and photoluminescence excitation spectra. The orderly distribution of QDs is confirmed from the correlation between full width at half-maximum of PL spectra Urbach energy and TEM analysis. The versatile photocatalytic activity has been tested toward Cr(VI) reduction and degradation of phenol. 3% CdS QDs-sensitized self-doped Bi2MoO6 showed highest activity, i.e., 97 and 47.5% toward reduction of Cr(VI) and degradation of phenol under solar light. The reduction of Cr(VI) by the catalyst is supported by the kinetics and determination of the pHPZC value. In addition to this, the photostability and reusability test showed that the catalyst can be reused up to five cycles without diminishing its activity.","['Siksha O Anusandhan (Deemed to be University)', 'Universidad de Chile']","['India', 'Chile']","['Thirumurugan A.', 'Kandi D.', 'Parida K.M.', 'Martha S.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,75,40.0,2017
Effect of cs-incorporated NiOx on the performance of perovskite solar cells,"© 2017 American Chemical SocietyThe effect of Cs-incorporated NiOx on perovskite solar cells with an inverted structure was investigated, where NiOx and PCBM were used as selective contacts for holes and electrons, respectively. It was found that the generation of an Ni phase in an NiOx layer was significantly suppressed by employing cesium. Furthermore, Cs-incorporated NiOx enabled holes to be efficiently separated at the interface, showing the improved photoluminescent quenching and thus generating higher short-circuit current. The effect of Cs incorporation was also prominent in the inhibition of recombination. The recombination resistance of Cs-incorporated NiOx was noticeably increased by more than three-fold near the maximum power point leading to a higher fill factor of 0.78 and consequently a higher power conversion efficiency of 17.2% for the device employing Cs-incorporated NiOx.","['École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne', 'Institut Català de Nanociència i Nanotecnologia', 'the School of Basic Sciences']","['Switzerland', 'United States', 'Spain']","['Lira-Cantu M.', 'Zakeeruddin S.M.', 'Xie H.', 'Hagfeldt A.', 'Seo J.-Y.', 'Kim H.-S.', 'Gratzel M.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,38,42.0,2017
Enhancement of polarization in ferroelectric films via the incorporation of gold nanoparticles,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Ferroelectric thin films have been extremely studied for many applications such as nonvolatile memories, super capacitors, and solar cells. For these devices, improving the polarization properties of ferroelectric thin films is of great significance to their performance. Here, Au−lead zirconate titanate (PZT) nanocomposite thin films were prepared by a simple one-step chemical solution deposition (CSD) method on silicon substrates, and the effects of Au concentration on the ferroelectric properties were investigated. The experimental results show that the remanent polarization of the Au−PZT films with 1.2 mol % Au is about 80 μC/cm2, which is 50% higher than that of the pure PZT thin films. On the basis of the analysis of chemical valences, the enhanced polarization properties can be ascribed to the interaction between Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) and PZT at the Au− PZT interfaces. Our results demonstrate that the incorporation of an appropriate amount of Au NPs is an effective way to enhance the polarization properties of ferroelectric films. The Au−PZT nanocomposite thin films with excellent polarization properties on silicon substrates are expected to be widely used in integrated ferroelectric devices.","['Northeastern University', 'Institute of Metal Research Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'Shenyang University of Technology']",['China'],"['Zhang Z.D.', 'Bai Y.', 'Cui J.Z.', 'Wang Z.J.', 'He B.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,13,38.0,2017
Simultaneous hardening/ductilizing effects of cryogenic nanohybridization of biopolyamides with montmorillonites,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.We prepared organic/inorganic bionanohybrid resins of polyamides containing pyrrolidone in the backbone derived from the salt monomers of an itaconic acid biomolecule with various nanofillers, montmorillonites (MMTs), by cryogenic nanohybridizations. The nanohybridizations with MMTs hardened and strengthened the polypyrrolidone bioplastic resins owing to a simple reinforcement of hard filler incorporation. On the other hand, the elongation at break of the resins is unexpectedly increased by the nanohybridization with MMT sodium salt (NaMMT) to enhance the strain energy density, which differed from those of the nanohybrids with other organically modified MMTs. From spectroscopic analyses, we discuss the mechanism of such ductilization effects by NaMMT, the catalytic effect of NaMMT on partially opening the pyrrolidone ring to make polymer backbones flexible and to form carboxyl side chains that are strongly interactive with NaMMT fillers.",['Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology'],['Japan'],"['Tandon N.', 'Ali M.A.', 'Kaneko T.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,3,30.0,2017
Engineered (Lys)6‑tagged recombinant sulfide-reactive hemoglobin I for covalent immobilization at multiwalled carbon nanotubes,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.The recombinant HbI was fused with a poly-Lys tag ((Lys)6-tagged rHbI) for specific-site covalent immobilization on two carbon nanotube transducer surfaces, i.e., powder and vertically aligned carbon nanotubes. The immobilization was achieved by following two steps: (1) generation of amine-reactive ester from the carboxylic acid groups of the surfaces and (2) coupling these groups with the amine groups of the Lys-tag. We analyzed the immobilization process using different conditions and techniques to differentiate protein covalent attachment from physical adsorption. Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy data showed a 14 cm−1 displacement of the protein’s amide I and amide II peaks to lower the frequency after immobilization. This result indicates a covalent attachment of the protein to the surface. Differences in the morphology of the carbon substrate with and without (Lys)6-tagged rHbI confirmed protein immobilization, as observed by transmission electron microscopy. The electrochemical studies which were performed to evaluate the redox center of the immobilized protein, show a confinement suitable for an efficient electron transfer system. More importantly, the electrochemical studies allowed determination of a redox potential for the new (Lys)6-tagged rHbI. The data show that the protein is electrochemically active and retains its biological activity toward H2S.","['Universidad de Puerto Rico en Cayey', 'Recinto Universitario de Mayagüez', 'Universidad de Puerto Rico, Recinto de Rio Piedras']",['Puerto Rico'],"['Lopez-Garriga J.', 'Torres-Gonzalez L.', 'Pietri R.', 'Cabrera C.R.', 'Diaz-Ayala R.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,6,59.0,2017
"Aqueous-solution-processed Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 thin-film solar cells via an improved successive ion-layer-adsorption∑reaction sequence","© 2017 American Chemical Society.A facile improved successive ionic-layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) sequence is described for the fabrication of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) thin-film solar cells (TFSCs) via the selenization of a precursor film. The precursor films were fabricated using a modified SILAR sequence to overcome compositional inhomogeneity due to different adsorptivities of the cations (Cu+, Sn4+, and Zn2+) in a single cationic bath. Rapid thermal annealing of the precursor films under S and Se vapor atmospheres led to the formation of carbon-free Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) and CZTSSe absorber layers, respectively, with single large-grained layers. The best devices based on CZTS and CZTSSe absorber layers showed total area (∼0.30 cm2) power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 1.96 and 3.74%, respectively, which are notably the first-demonstrated efficiencies using a modified SILAR sequence. Detailed diode analyses of these solar cells revealed that a high shunt conductance (Gsh), reverse saturation current density (Jo), and ideality factor (nd) significantly affected the PCE, open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF), whereas the short-circuit current density (Jsc) was dominated by the series resistance (Rs) and Gsh. However, the diode analyses combined with the compositional and interface microstructural analyses shed light on further improvements to the device efficiency. The facile layer-by-layer growth of the kesterite CZTS-based thin films in aqueous solution provides a great promise as an environmentally benign pathway to fabricate a variety of multielement-component compounds with high compositional homogeneities.","['Shivaji University', 'Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology', 'Chonnam National University', 'Korea Institute of Energy Research']","['South Korea', 'India']","['He M.', 'Patil P.S.', 'Moholkar A.V.', 'Ghorpade U.V.', 'Kim J.H.', 'Yun J.H.', 'Gang M.G.', 'Suryawanshi M.P.', 'Kim J.', 'Suryawanshi U.P.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,21,42.0,2017
Roles of active-site aromatic residues in cold adaptation of sphingomonas glacialis esterase EstSP1,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.The aromatic amino acids, Tyr or Trp, which line the active-site walls of esterases, stabilize the catalytic His loop via hydrogen bonding. A Tyr residue is preferred in extremophilic esterases (psychrophilic or hyperthermophilic esterases), whereas a Trp residue is preferred in moderate-temperature esterases. Here, we provide evidence that Tyr and Trp play distinct roles in cold adaptation of the psychrophilic esterase EstSP1 isolated from an Arctic bacterium Sphingomonas glacialis PAMC 26605. Stern−Volmer plots showed that the mutation of Tyr191 to Ala, Phe, Trp, and His resulted in reduced conformational flexibility of the overall protein structure. Interestingly, the Y191W and Y191H mutants showed increased thermal stability at moderate temperatures. All Tyr191 mutants showed reduced catalytic activity relative to wild-type EstSP1. Our results indicate that Tyr with its phenyl hydroxyl group is favored for increased conformational flexibility and high catalytic activity of EstSP1 at low temperatures at the expense of thermal stability. The results of this study suggest that, in the permanently cold Arctic zone, enzyme activity has been selected for psychrophilic enzymes over thermal stability. The results presented herein provide novel insight into the roles of Tyr and Trp residues for temperature adaptation of enzymes that function at low, moderate, and high temperatures.",['Daegu University'],['South Korea'],"['Lee C.', 'Jang S.-H.', 'Tran L.-H.', 'Kashif A.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,12,63.0,2017
Plurality as a form of (Mis)management of international dispute settlement: Afterword to Laurence Boisson de Chazournes' Foreword,"© The Author(s), 2018.

All rights reserved.In 'Plurality in the Fabric of International Courts and Tribunals: The Threads of a Managerial Approach', Laurence Boisson de Chazournes maps out the variety of legal doctrines and communicative devices that allow international courts to navigate the course of international dispute settlement in ways that avert serious jurisdictional or jurisprudential clashes between different international courts. This reply is largely supportive of Boisson de Chazournes' account of an evolving judicial 'managerial approach'. It questions, however, whether international courts are truly committed to a 'managerial approach' and whether such an approach is likely to succeed in the long run without a structural redesign of the 'fabric of international dispute settlement'. Section 2 of the Afterword discusses jurisdictional plurality as a deliberate choice by states, which is likely to restrict the coherence of international law. Section 3 discusses the dilemmas facing international courts: the choice of a pro-coherence 'management approach' may conflict with other mandated functions, including providing the litigating parties with cost-effective dispute settlement services and supporting the particular needs of the legal regimes in which they are embedded.

Liability to international prosecution: The nature of universal jurisdiction,"© The Author(s), 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of EJIL Ltd. All rights reserved.This article considers the proper method for theorizing about criminal jurisdiction. It challenges a received understanding of how to substantiate the right to punish and articulates an alternative account of how that theoretical task is properly conducted. The received view says that a special relationship is the ground of a tribunal's authority to prosecute and, hence, that a normative theory of that authority is faced with identifying a distinctive relation. The alternative account locates prosecutorial standing on an institution's capacity to address the basic reasons generating criminal liability. This reframes the normative issues at stake and has the result that various, perhaps quite heterogeneous, considerations can substantiate penal authority. It also eliminates the existence of a special relation as a necessary condition for legitimate criminal accountability. The argument proceeds by offering an analysis and account of universal jurisdiction. Not only does the alternative elegantly perform where the received view struggles, it can accommodate much of what motivates the pursuit of relational ties in existing efforts to vindicate jurisdictional conclusions.",['Binghamton University State University of New York'],['United States'],['Reeves A.R.'],,European Journal of International Law,Oxford University Press,"['Law', 'Political Science and International Relations']",['SOCI'],Article,6,20.0,2018

All rights reserved.In this Afterword in response to the Foreword by Laurence Boisson de Chazournes, I argue that to address the challenges of coordination between the growing number of international courts and tribunals, the role of international judges is necessary but not sufficient. Overcoming the various obstacles requires not only clarifying rules and relationships (exante specification) but also adding mechanisms that effectively accommodate interests while limiting pitfalls and contributing to calibrating adjudicatory authority (ex-post control). Such additional tools may help to control the tribunals' ability to make and apply their decisions. They also can serve to relieve the international law processes from the pressures exerted by excessive legal 'experimentalism'. Among the most obvious of such tools emerging in international economic agreements are consolidation or joint decision-making provisions, stays and under-ride processes, interaction requirements or special delegation arrangements.",['The University of Arizona'],['United States'],['Puig S.'],,European Journal of International Law,Oxford University Press,"['Law', 'Political Science and International Relations']",['SOCI'],Article,1,19.0,2018

The threads (or threats?) of a managerial approach: Afterword to Laurence Boisson de Chazournes' Foreword,"© The Author(s), 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of EJIL Ltd. All rights reserved.In her EJIL Foreword article, Boisson de Chazournes gives an optimistic account of the proliferation of international courts and tribunals. She argues that the proliferation has been a constant and desired feature of international dispute settlement and that problems arising from it can be resolved through 'internal communication' among judicial bodies and through various procedural rules preventing jurisdictional overlaps. These tools, richly illustrated by numerous examples primarily from the area of international economic law, attest, in the author's view, to the emergence of a new, managerial approach. In my Afterword, I consider what this managerial approach consists of and how it relates to the other 'managerial theories' known in international law-the managerial model of Abram Chayes and Antonia Handler Chayes and managerialism described by Martti Koskenniemi. I argue that the managerial approach is close to the former theory and, as such, is also vulnerable to the reservations raised against it (formalism, excessive optimism). I further argue that the managerial approach is not identical to managerialism but that the article, placing so much emphasis on formal, procedural rules, might not do enough to prevent the confusion between the two.",['Charles University'],['Czech Republic'],['Bilkova V.'],,European Journal of International Law,Oxford University Press,"['Law', 'Political Science and International Relations']",['SOCI'],Article,1,14.0,2018

Protecting the environment through sports? Public-private cooperation for regulatory resources and international law,"© The Author(s), 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of EJIL Ltd. All rights reserved.This article examines a common, yet insufficiently researched, phenomenon: regulatory cooperation between public and private actors at the global level. It uses a case study that starts from the cooperation between the Olympic Movement and the United Nations Environmental Programme and then examines more broadly areas of convergences between sports and environmental regulation. The article depicts why a private regulator and an international organization would cooperate and what this tells us about the relationship between 'expertise', 'power' and 'legitimacy' within global governance. Two arguments are put forward and developed in the article. First, regulators cooperate because, in an unsettled global space with no hierarchical framework, cooperation is necessary for them to acquire sufficient authority to secure compliance with their regulatory agenda; cooperation opens a venue for the exchange of necessary regulatory resources and, thus, ultimately helps regulators establish and strengthen their authority. Second, because of the rate of recurrence of regulatory cooperation on a global scale, the article calls for the integration of the concept of regulatory cooperation into international law scholarship to help recognize and formalize this practice. It aims to encourage a debate about the risks and benefits involved in these regulatory interactions and about a (legal) framework that could safeguard important public policy interests.",['University College Dublin'],['Ireland'],['Schmidt R.'],,European Journal of International Law,Oxford University Press,"['Law', 'Political Science and International Relations']",['SOCI'],Article,6,98.0,2018
Rights under international humanitarian law,"© The Author(s), 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of EJIL Ltd. All rights reserved.The idea of 'rights' under the law of war historically referred to state or belligerent rights-that is, rights to engage in actions not permitted under the law of peace. The different sense of rights of individuals was absent from those traditional accounts of the law, and whether individuals are granted rights (for example, of prisoners of war to be humanely treated, of civilians not to be targeted) under contemporary international humanitarian law (IHL) remains contested. This article explores how this debate has developed in recent history. It argues that clear support for the notion of individual rights during the drafting of the 1907 Hague Convention IV and subsequent treaties seemed to be overtaken by state practice in the area of war reparations, only to re-emerge in more recent practice that, in part, is shown to be a result of a more legalized approach to the invocation of responsibility for IHL violations. This growing support for the individual rights perspective of IHL is then juxtaposed with the re-emergence of state rights. The article concludes that these two different notions of 'rights' under IHL present two fundamentally opposing visions for the law's role in regulating armed conflict.",['University of Reading'],['United Kingdom'],['Hill-Cawthorne L.'],,European Journal of International Law,Oxford University Press,"['Law', 'Political Science and International Relations']",['SOCI'],Article,7,84.0,2018
Experimenting with International Law,"© The Author(s), 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of EJIL Ltd.

International legal scholars, however, are still in the early stages of adopting experimental methods. Indeed, Yahli Shereshevsky and Tom Noah's article is one of the first experimental studies to appear in the European Journal of International Law. Its publication thus provides an opportunity to reflect not only on this pioneering work but also on the broader 'experimental turn' in the study of international law. To do so, we begin by motivating the experimental turn, which we argue reflects both a methodological shift from observational studies towards the increasing use of experiments and a theoretical shift from rational choice towards cognitive psychology and behavioural economics. Second, we engage in a critical reading of Shereshevsky and Noah's study of the impact of preparatory materials on treaty interpretation. Applying the dual criteria of internal and external validity, we assess the strengths and weaknesses of Shereshevsky and Noah's study. We conclude that experiments promise to extend our knowledge of international law and are likely to become increasingly influential in scholarly and policy debates.

Reflections on role responsibility: The responsibility of international organizations for failing to act,"© The Author(s), 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of EJIL Ltd. All rights reserved.This article investigates whether international organizations can be held responsible under international law when they fail to act. It aims to conceptualize the notion of 'omission' in the international law on the responsibility of international organizations and does so in four broad steps. First, a discussion of the most well-known failure (the United Nations' refusal to intervene in the Rwandan genocide in 1994) suggests that there is a need to conceptualize the omission and to reflect on the sort of factors that may cause a failure to act. Second, the article investigates how omissions have been addressed in the literature and in the codification of the law on responsibility and finds that little attention has been paid to omissions, and where attention has been paid, it has been limited to viewing the omission as the mirror image of the act. Third, the article addresses as one element of a relevant concept of omission that the organization must be in a position to act, and, fourth, it establishes the basis of an obligation to act in some circumstances on the basis of the organization's mandate, thus introducing a version of what can be called 'role responsibility' into international law.","['Helsingin Yliopisto', 'Erasmus School of Law']","['Finland', 'Netherlands']",['Klabbers J.'],,European Journal of International Law,Oxford University Press,"['Law', 'Political Science and International Relations']",['SOCI'],Article,9,80.0,2018

Radical dissents in international criminal trials,"© The Author(s), 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of EJIL Ltd. All rights reserved.International criminal law, for much of its history, has been a law characterized by dissents. However, international law scholarship has largely ignored the role of the dissenting opinion in shaping the discourse of international criminal law. This article critically examines the nature and function of dissents at international criminal tribunals at a particularly crucial moment in the life of these courts, when the project of establishing accountability for mass atrocity through criminal trials is increasingly under attack. The article argues that the dissenting opinion is a crucial legal device that can have a transformative potential in international criminal adjudication through its creation of a civic space for contestation that paradoxically shores up the legitimacy of the international criminal trial. To this end, it constructs a discrete category of dissenting opinions at international criminal courts: 'radical dissents'. The content and rhetorical style of a radical dissent enables actors invested in the project of international criminal justice to use it as a vital dissentient voice both within and outside the courtroom. Agents who operate within the confines of the legal trial, such as defendants, lawyers, appellate chambers and future judges, may channel its authority to challenge the idiom in which the majority judgment speaks. Likewise, the radical dissent could provide a legal language through which academics, victims, civil society and other affected communities continue to grapple with constructing and coming to terms with events that defy human understanding.","['University of Minnesota Law School', 'Stellenbosch University']","['United States', 'South Africa']",['Jain N.'],,European Journal of International Law,Oxford University Press,"['Law', 'Political Science and International Relations']",['SOCI'],Article,14,66.0,2018
"Techniques in international law-making: Extrapolation, analogy, form and the emergence of an international law of disaster relief","© The Author(s), 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of EJIL Ltd. All rights reserved.This article traces the emergence of an international law of disaster relief from a patchwork of norms through to a holistic body of international law. It argues that, for many years, the international law of disaster relief existed in piecemeal fashion. Since there is no overarching treaty on the subject at the global level, a hodgepodge of instruments have been concluded, namely subject-specific and disaster-specific treaties at the global level, regional and sub-regional agreements, bilateral agreements as well as soft law. However, through the work of the International Law Commission and the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, a holistic body of international law relating to disaster relief is in the process of emerging. This article argues that this holistic body is emerging primarily as a result of three techniques that, while unconventional, are used relatively frequently in the making of international law. The three techniques are: (i) extrapolation from a series of piecemeal instruments to form a generalized standard; (ii) the use of analogy and (iii) the conclusion of instruments that are soft in form but contain a mixture of hard law and soft law. The way in which the techniques have been used to develop a body of international law relating to disaster relief is analysed, their use in other fields of international law discussed and limitations on their use in the disaster law context identified.",['University of Nottingham'],['United Kingdom'],['Sivakumaran S.'],,European Journal of International Law,Oxford University Press,"['Law', 'Political Science and International Relations']",['SOCI'],Article,13,83.0,2018
The responsibility to protect beyond borders in the Law of Nature and Nations,"© The Author(s), 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of EJIL Ltd. All rights reserved.While histories of human rights have proliferated in recent decades, little attention has been given to the history of thinking about duties to protect these rights beyond sovereign borders. We have a good understanding of the history of duties of sovereign states to ensure the safety and well-being of their own citizens and of the right of other states to forcefully intervene when these duties are violated. But the story of the development of thinking about duties to assist and protect the vulnerable beyond borders remains to be told.

Winners and losers of the plurality of international courts and tribunals: Afterword to Laurence boisson de Chazournes' foreword,"© The Author(s), 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of EJIL Ltd. All rights reserved.By asking about 'winners and losers', this reply questions the preference of states for a plurality of international courts and tribunals, challenges the coherence of the international legal order as a dominant rationale for judicial actors to coordinate, and raises doubts about their overall success in managing plurality. It argues that their coordinating efforts have to be understood as reactive rather than proactive steps in a complex decision-making environment in which litigants, their lawyers, and domestic courts play a significant but underappreciated role. While it is true that some coordination between judicial actors exists, it remains to be seen whether the 'threads of a managerial approach' amount to more than thin, singular, and often random strings that will develop into dense, resilient, and predictable webs of international jurisprudence.",['NYU Law'],['United States'],['Streinz T.'],,European Journal of International Law,Oxford University Press,"['Law', 'Political Science and International Relations']",['SOCI'],Article,1,10.0,2018
Does exposure to preparatory work affect treaty interpretation? An experimental study on international law students and experts,"© The Author(s), 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of EJIL Ltd. All rights reserved.Ample research has demonstrated that exposure to inadmissible evidence affects decision making in criminal and civil cases. However, the difficulty of ignoring information in the context of legal interpretation has not been examined yet. Our study addresses the possible effects that exposure to preparatory work has on the interpretation of treaties. In the present article, we examine the ability of students enrolled in international law courses and of international law experts to ignore preparatory work when they are not allowed to use it. We found that exposure to preparatory work affected the students' interpretation of treaties, while no such effect was found among the experts. These results reaffirm the practical relevance of the debate over the hierarchy between the rules of treaty interpretation. In particular, our study demonstrates that preparatory work can play a significant role in decision making, depending on the legal rule that applies to the use of such materials. More generally, our study suggests that legal interpretation by students and experts is qualitatively different and that international law experts might be better able than non-experts to discount irrelevant information in the process of treaty interpretation.","['University of Michigan Law School', 'Hebrew University of Jerusalem']","['United States', 'Israel']","['Noah T.', 'Shereshevsky Y.']",,European Journal of International Law,Oxford University Press,"['Law', 'Political Science and International Relations']",['SOCI'],Article,11,65.0,2018

Long-Term Underwater Hydrophobicity: Exploring Topographic and Chemical Requirements,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.A family of hybrid organoinorganic silica-based particles with varied chemical natures and morphologies has been synthesized to test their ability to develop coatings with underwater hydrophobicity. The particles were characterized by elemental microanalysis, scanning electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering to evaluate the organic content, observe the morphology, and estimate the aggregate size, respectively. These morphologies were transferred into surface topographies by spraycoating dispersions made from the particles onto glass supports, resulting in coatings with an ample range of profiles and roughness but all of them being superhydrophobic. Atomic force microscopy and optical profilometry were used to map the coating surfaces and analyze the topography. Then, underwater hydrophobicity endurance was tested by immersion under a 2 cm 20 °C water column perpendicular to circular glass supports coated with the particles. The so-called mirror effect derived from the occurrence of the primary plastron (continuous air layer occluded between the surface and the water) was observed on the surface of all of the coatings tested. Apart from the dependency of plastrons on the water temperature and substrate shape, the plastron quality and lifetime is notably different depending on the particle morphology and thus on the coating topography. These experiments have demonstrated that the most persistent mirror effects, and therefore underwater superhydrophobicity, were produced on coatings that exhibited the smoothest topographies at the micrometric scale. In addition, these particle-only coatings can be made mechanically stable and robust by blending with a polymer matrix.",['CSIC - Instituto de Ciencia y Tecnologia de Polimeros (ICTP)'],['Spain'],"['Tiemblo P.', 'Garcia N.', 'De Francisco R.', 'Martinez-Gomez A.', 'Lopez S.', 'Garcia T.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,14,34.0,2017
Preparation of Gold Nanocomposites with Tunable Charge and Hydrophobicity via the Application of Polymer/Surfactant Complexation,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.During the synthesis of gold nanoparticle (NP) assemblies, the interfacial charge and hydrophobicity of the primary particles play a distinguished role. In the present article, we demonstrate that the association of poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) capped gold NPs with sodium alkyl sulfates provide a powerful route for the manipulation of these interfacial properties. Dynamic light-scattering, electrophoretic mobility, UV-vis-near-infrared spectroscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and transmission electron microscopy measurements were used to characterize the PEI/surfactant/gold nanoassemblies. The results indicate the formation of gold NPs surrounded by a PEI/surfactant shell with composition-dependent charge and hydrophobicity. The mean size and the aggregation of the nanoassemblies can be fine tuned by the amount of surfactant bound to the primary gold NPs as well as by the application of controlled mixing methods. The specific features of the prepared nanocomposites may be further exploited in next-generation applications.","['Eötvös Loránd Tudományegyetem', 'Magyar Tudomanyos Akademia', 'Univerzita J.

Synthesis of core–shell structured FAU/SBA-15 composite molecular sieves and their performance in catalytic cracking of polystyrene,"© 2017 The Author(s). Published by National Institute for Materials Science in partnership with Taylor & Francis.Composite molecular sieves, FAU/SBA-15, having core-shell structure were synthesized. The synthesized composite sieves were characterized by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), pyrolysis fourier transform infrared (Py-FTIR) spectroscopy, temperature programmed desorption spectra (NH3-TPD), UV Raman spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and other techniques. XRD, SEM, TEM, N2 adsorption-desorption, mass spectrometry, NMR and EDS results showed that the composite molecular sieve contained two pore channels. Py-FTIR results showed that the addition of HY molecular sieves improved the acidity of the composite zeolite. The crystallization mechanism during the growth of FAU/SBA-15 shell was deduced from the influence of crystallization time on the synthesis of FAU/SBA-15 core-shell structured composite molecular sieve. HY dissociated partially in H2SO4 solution, and consisted of secondary structural units. This framework structure was more stable than its presence in the isolated form on the same ring or in the absence of Al. Thus it played a guiding role and connected with SBA-15 closely through the Si-O bond. This resulted in the gradual covering of the exterior surface of FAU phase by SBA-15 molecular sieves. The presence of SBA-15 restricted the formation of the other high mass components and increased the selectivity towards ethylbenzene.","['Northeastern University', 'Liaoning University of Petroleum and Chemical Technology', 'Inha University']","['South Korea', 'China']","['Chen P.', 'Du J.', 'Shi C.', 'Wu W.', 'Bian X.', 'Cui Q.', 'Cui Z.']","['composite molecular sieve', 'Core–shell', 'FAU', 'growth mechanism', 'SBA-15']",Science and Technology of Advanced Materials,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,['Materials Science (all)'],['MATE'],Article,9,38.0,2017
Pyridylhydroxybutyl and pyridyloxobutyl DNA phosphate adduct formation in rats treated chronically with enantiomers of the tobacco-specific nitrosamine metabolite 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol,"© The Author(s) 2017. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the UK Environmental Mutagen Society. All rights reserved.The tobacco-specific lung carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) is metabolically converted to 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) in a reaction which is both stereoselective and reversible. NNAL is also a lung carcinogen, with both (R)- NNAL and (S)-NNAL inducing a high incidence of lung tumours in rats. Both NNAL and NNK undergo metabolic activation to intermediates which react with DNA to form pyridylhydroxybutyl and pyridyloxobutyl DNA adducts, respectively. DNA adduct formation by NNAL and NNK is an important step in their mechanisms of carcinogenesis. In this study, we quantified both pyridylhydroxybutyl and pyridyloxobutyl DNA phosphate adducts in the lung of rats treated with 5 ppm of (R)-NNAL or (S)-NNAL in drinking water for 10, 30, 50 and 70 weeks. In (R)-NNAL-treated rats, the pyridylhydroxybutyl and pyridyloxobutyl phosphate adducts were 4530-6920 fmol/mg DNA and 46-175 fmol/mg DNA, accounting for 45-51% and 0.3-1% of the total measured DNA phosphate and base adducts, respectively. In (S)-NNAL-treated rats, the two types of phosphate adducts were 3480-4180 fmol/mg DNA and 1180-4650 fmol/mg DNA, accounting for 30-36% and 11-38% of the total adducts, respectively. Distinct patterns of adduct formation were observed, with higher levels of NNAL-derived pyridylhydroxybutyl phosphate adducts and lower levels of NNK-derived pyridyloxobutyl phosphate adducts in the (R)-NNAL treatment group than the (S)- NNAL group. The persistence and increase over time of certain pyridylhydroxybutyl phosphate adducts over the course of the study suggest that these adducts could be useful biomarkers of chronic exposure to NNAL and NNK.

Folate deficiency induces mitotic aberrations and chromosomal instability by compromising the spindle assembly checkpoint in cultured human colon cells,"© The Author(s) 2017. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the UK Environmental Mutagen Society. All rights reserved.Folates comprise the essential B9 vitamin that act as cofactors and cosubstrates in one-carbon metabolism for both biosynthesis and methylation of DNA and RNA. Folate deficiency (FD) has been shown to induce chromosomal instability (CIN), yet the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we used human NCM460 colon mucosal cells as a model to investigate the effect of FD on spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), a cell-cycle regulatory pathway preventing CIN during mitosis. Cells were maintained in medium containing 1.36 (FD) and 2260 nM (control, FC) folate for 21 days. CIN was measured by cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay; mitotic infidelity was determined by aberrant mitosis analysis; SAC activity was assessed by nocodazole-challenge assay, and the expression of core SAC genes was examined by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). We found that, relative to FC, FD significantly induced CIN in a time-dependent way (P < 0.01). Mitotic cells cultured in FD medium had significant higher frequencies of misalignment, misegregation and spindle multipolarity than those cultured in FC medium (P < 0.01). FD-induced SAC impairment and overriding, resulting premature mitotic exit and cell multinucleation (P < 0.05). Moreover, FD deregulated the expression of several key SAC genes (P < 0.01). Overall, these data are the first to demonstrate that FD substantially compromises SAC network which predisposes cells to mitotic aberrations and CIN. These results establish a new link between folate metabolism and SAC signalling, two pathways that are highly relevant for tumorigenesis.","['China Gene Health Management Group, Ltd.', 'Yunnan University', 'Yunnan Normal University']",['China'],"['Ni J.', 'Zhou T.', 'Guo X.', 'Zhu Y.', 'Wang X.', 'Ma X.', 'Xue J.']",,Mutagenesis,Oxford University Press,"['Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis', 'Toxicology', 'Genetics', 'Genetics (clinical)']","['ENVI', 'PHAR', 'BIOC', 'MEDI']",Article,29,55.0,2017
Novel mutations in the lipase H gene lead to secretion defects of LIPH in Chinese patients with autosomal recessive woolly hair/hypotrichosis (ARWH/HT),"© The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the UK Environmental Mutagen Society. All rights reserved.Autosomal recessive woolly hair/hypotrichosis (ARWH/HT: OMIM #278150/604379) is a rare hereditary hair disease characterized by tightly curled hair at birth which can lead to sparse hair later in life. The mutations in both LIPH and LPAR6/P2RY5 are responsible for autosomal recessive woolly hair with or without hypotrichosis (ARWH/HT). To conduct clinical and genetic investigations in four patients from three unrelated Chinese Han families with ARWH/HT, we performed mutation screening of LIPH and LPAR6/P2RY5 gene and identified four mutations in LIPH: c.454G>A, c.614A>G, c.736T>A, c.742C>A. c.736T>A and c.742C>A mutations were reported in previous studies, and c.454G>A, c.614A>G were identified for the first time. We carried out functional studies of the two mutants with c.454G>A (p.Gly152Arg, G152R) or c.614A>G (p.His205Arg, H205R). Interestingly, both of them lead to secretion defects of LIPH, which are involved in the pathogenesis of ARWH/HT.","['Peking University Health Science Center', 'Peking University Third Hospital', 'Peking University']",['China'],"['Gu Y.-J.', 'Dai S.', 'Song Q.-H.', 'Chen X.-R.', 'Zhang C.-L.', 'Zhao H.-S.', 'Chang X.-D.']",,Mutagenesis,Oxford University Press,"['Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis', 'Toxicology', 'Genetics', 'Genetics (clinical)']","['ENVI', 'PHAR', 'BIOC', 'MEDI']",Article,9,19.0,2018
"Influence of dispersion medium on nanomaterial-induced pulmonary inflammation and DNA strand breaks: Investigation of carbon black, carbon nanotubes and three titanium dioxide nanoparticles","© The Author(s) 2017. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the UK Environmental Mutagen Society.Intratracheal instillation serves as a model for inhalation exposure. However, for this, materials are dispersed in appropriate media that may influence toxicity. We tested whether different intratracheal instillation dispersion media influence the pulmonary toxicity of different nanomaterials. Rodents were intratracheally instilled with 162 μg/mouse/1620 μg/rat carbon black (CB), 67 μg/mouse titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2) or 54 μg/mouse carbon nanotubes (CNT). The dispersion media were as follows: water (CB, TiO2); 2% serum in water (CB, CNT, TiO2); 0.05% serum albumin in water (CB, CNT, TiO2); 10% bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in 0.9% NaCl (CB), 10% bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in water (CB) or 0.1% Tween-80 in water (CB). Inflammation was measured as pulmonary influx of neutrophils into bronchoalveolar fluid, and DNA damage as DNA strand breaks in BAL cells by comet assay. Inflammation was observed for all nanomaterials (except 38-nm TiO2) in all dispersion media. For CB, inflammation was dispersion medium dependent. Increased levels of DNA strand breaks for CB were observed only in water, 2% serum and 10% BAL fluid in 0.9% NaCl. No dispersion medium-dependent effects on genotoxicity were observed for TiO2, whereas CNT in 2% serum induced higher DNA strand break levels than in 0.05% serum albumin. In conclusion, the dispersion medium was a determinant of CB-induced inflammation and genotoxicity. Water seemed to be the best dispersion medium to mimic CB inhalation, exhibiting DNA strand breaks with only limited inflammation. The influence of dispersion media on nanomaterial toxicity should be considered in the planning of intratracheal investigations.","['Det Nationale Forskningscenter for Arbejdsmiljø', 'Statens arbeidsmiljøinstitutt', 'Instytut Medycyny Pracy im.

Spectrum of Pig-a mutations in T lymphocytes of rats treated with procarbazine,"© The Author(s) 2017. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the UK Environmental Mutagen Society. All rights reserved.Procarbazine is a primary component of antineoplastic combination chemotherapy often used for the treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma. It is believed that cytostatic and cytotoxic properties of procarbazine are mediated via its interaction with genomic DNA. Procarbazine is a carcinogen in animal models; it is classified as Group 2A compound by IARC. Also it is known as an in vitro and in vivo mutagen and genotoxicant. However, the molecular mechanism by which procarbazine induces mutations is not thoroughly understood and the spectrum of procarbazine-induced in vivo mutations is described insufficiently. We employed flow cytometry-based erythrocyte and T lymphocyte assays in order to quantify the frequencies of cells deficient in glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-anchored surface markers CD59 and CD48 (presumed mutants in the endogenous X-linked Pig-a gene) in rats. The rats were treated once daily with 100 mg/kg procarbazine HCl for 3 days. In addition, we sorted mutant-phenotype spleen T cells and immediately analysed their Pig-a gene using next generation sequencing of dual-indexed multiplex libraries and error-correcting data filtering. More than 100-fold increase in the frequencies of CD59-deficient RBCs was observed at Day 29 after the last administration, and a 10-fold increase in the frequency of CD48-deficient T cells was observed at Days 45 to 50. Sequencing revealed that, in T cells from procarbazinetreated rats, mutations in the Pig-a gene occurred predominantly at A:T basepairs when A was located on the non-transcribed DNA strand. A?T transversion was the most common mutation. Our results suggest that, at least for the transcribed X-linked Pig-a gene, in vivo methyl guanine adducts are not the major contributors to mutations induced by procarbazine.","['Covance Laboratories Inc.', 'University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown', 'National Center for Toxicological Research']",['United States'],"['McKinzie P.', 'Thomas D.', 'Bhalli J.A.', 'Dobrovolsky V.N.', 'Tebbe C.', 'Pearce M.G.', 'Revollo J.', 'Noteboom J.', 'Felton N.']",,Mutagenesis,Oxford University Press,"['Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis', 'Toxicology', 'Genetics', 'Genetics (clinical)']","['ENVI', 'PHAR', 'BIOC', 'MEDI']",Article,13,21.0,2017
Silver-Decorated Boron Nitride Nanosheets as an Effective Hybrid Filler in PMMA for High-Thermal-Conductivity Electronic Substrates,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.High-thermal-conductivity and low-dielectric-loss polymer nanocomposites have gained tremendous attention in microelectronics technology. Against this background, the present study deals with the development of a high-thermal-conductivity, low-dielectric-constant, and low-loss polymer nanocomposite based on silver nanoparticle (AgNP)-decorated boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) as the filler in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix. The nanocomposites were prepared through a facile solution-blending process. Elemental mapping of the prepared nanocomposite indicates the uniform distribution of filler particle in PMMA matrix. An impressive high-thermal conductivity (TC) enhancement of around 363% was achieved for nanocomposite of 0.35 Vf of hybrid filler (1.48 W/m K) compared to pristine PMMA (0.32 W/m K). The addition of AgNP reduces the thermal contact resistance (Rc) by bridging individual BNNS, thereby improving thermal transport. Measured TC values were fitted with a theoretical model that showed good agreement. Dielectric measurements performed at radiofrequencies and microwave frequencies revealed that the nanocomposites show a low dielectric constant (<5), low loss (10-2), and very low alternating current conductivity (10-7 S/cm). The results suggest that silver-decorated BNNS is a promising hybrid filler for effective thermal management.","['National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology', 'Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR)']",['India'],"['Surendran K.P.', 'Pullanchiyodan A.', 'Nair K.S.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,34,65.0,2017

However, these have been drastically limited by the respective volatility and poor water solubility. The present study investigates the formation of inclusion complexes between BCP and methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) and shows that these complexes promote a significant improvement of the antiinflammatory, gastric protection, and antioxidant activities relative to neat BCP. It is shown that the solubility of BCP is significantly increased through complexation in phase solubility studies. Inclusion complexes with MβCD in solid state were prepared by three different methods, kneading, rotary evaporation, and lyophilization, with the latter confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, 1H NMR spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics studies. This study provides for the first time a full characterization of inclusion complexes between BCP and MβCD and highlights the impact of complex formation upon pharmacological activity.","['Universidade Federal do Piauí', 'Universidade de Coimbra, Faculdade de Farmácia', 'Faculty of Science and Technology', 'CQC']","['Brazil', 'United States', 'United Kingdom', 'Portugal']","['Araujo T.S.L.', 'Pais A.C.C.', 'Carvalho R.A.', 'Veiga F.J.B.', 'Souza L.K.M.', 'Medeiros J.V.R.', 'Figueiras A.', 'Santos P.S.', 'Nunes S.C.C.', 'Nunes L.C.C.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,32,81.0,2017
Probing the critical role of sn content in SnSb@C nanofiber anode on Li storage mechanism and battery performance,"© 2017 American Chemical SocietyThe minimization of the detrimental effects as a result of the drastic volume changes (few hundred times) occurring during repeated alloying−dealloying of lithium with group IV elements, e.g., tin (Sn), is a major challenge. An important design strategy is to have Sn as a component in a binary compound. SnSb is an important example where the antimony (Sb) itself is redox active at a potential higher than that of Sn. The ability of Sb to alloy with Li reduces the Li uptake amount of Sn in SnSb compared to that in bare Sn. Thus, the volume changes of Sn in SnSb will expectedly be much lower compared to that in bare Sn, leading to greater mechanical stability and cyclability. As revealed recently, the complete reformation of SnSb (for a molar ratio of Sn/Sb = 1:1) during charging is not achieved due to the loss of some fraction of Sn. Thus, the molar concentration of Sn and Sb in SnSb is also absolutely important for the optimization of battery performance. We discuss here SnSb with varying compositions of Sn encapsulated inside an electrospun carbon nanofiber (abbreviated as CF). The carbon-nanofiber matrix not only provides electron transport pathways for the redox process but also provides ample space to accommodate the drastic volume changes occurring during successive charge and discharge cycles. The systematic changes in the chemical composition of SnSb minimize the instabilities in SnSb structure as well as replenish any loss in Sn during repeated cycling. The composition plays a very crucial role, as magnitude of specific capacities and cyclability of SnSb are observed to depend on the variable percentage of Sn. SnSb-75-25-CF, which contains excess Sn, exhibits the highest specific capacity of 550 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles in comparison with pure SnSb (1:1) anode material at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 and shows excellent rate capability over widely varying current densities (0.2−5 A g−1).",['Indian Institute of Science'],['India'],"['Das S.', 'Guru Row T.N.', 'Bhattacharyya A.J.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,6,45.0,2017

"Contractions of degenerate quadratic Algebras, abstract and geometric","© 2017, Institute of Mathematics. All rights reserved.uadratic algebras are generalizations of Lie algebras which include the symmetry algebras of 2nd order superintegrable systems in 2 dimensions as special cases. The superintegrable systems are exactly solvable physical systems in classical and quantum mechanics. Distinct superintegrable systems and their quadratic algebras can be related by geometric contractions, induced by Bôcher contractions of the conformal Lie algebra so(4,ℂ) to itself. In 2 dimensions there are two kinds of quadratic algebras, nondegenerate and degenerate. In the geometric case these correspond to 3 parameter and 1 parameter potentials, respectively. In a previous paper we classified all abstract parameter-free nondegenerate quadratic algebras in terms of canonical forms and determined which of these can be realized as quadratic algebras of 2D nondegenerate superintegrable systems on constant curvature spaces and Darboux spaces, and studied the relationship between Bôcher contractions of these systems and abstract contractions of the free quadratic algebras. Here we carry out an analogous study of abstract parameter-free degenerate quadratic algebras and their possible geometric realizations. We show that the only free degenerate quadratic algebras that can be constructed in phase space are those that arise from superintegrability. We classify all Bôcher contractions relating degenerate superintegrable systems and, separately, all abstract contractions relating free degenerate quadratic algebras. We point out the few exceptions where abstract contractions cannot be realized by the geometric Bôcher contractions.","['Pennsylvania State University', 'University of Minnesota Twin Cities', 'University of Montreal']","['United States', 'Canada']","['Escobar Ruiz M.A.', 'Miller W.', 'Subag E.']","['Bôcher contractions', 'Conformal superintegrability', 'Poisson structures', 'Quadratic algebras', 'Superintegrable systems']","Symmetry, Integrability and Geometry: Methods and Applications (SIGMA)",Institute of Mathematics,"['Mathematical Physics', 'Geometry and Topology', 'Analysis']",['MATH'],Article,1,23.0,2017

Electronic tongue-A tool for all tastes?,"© 2018 by the authors.Electronic tongue systems are traditionally used to analyse: food products, water samples and taste masking technologies for pharmaceuticals. In principle, their applications are almost limitless, as they are able to almost completely reduce the impact of interferents and can be applied to distinguish samples of extreme complexity as for example broths from different stages of fermentation. Nevertheless, their applications outside the three principal sample types are, in comparison, rather scarce. In this review, we would like to take a closer look on what are real capabilities of electronic tongue systems, what can be achieved using mixed sensor arrays and by introduction of biosensors or molecularly imprinted polymers in the matrix.

Optimization of in vitro lily culture system with different treatments of taurine,"© Korean Society for Plant BioTechnology.Lilies as cut flowers are one of the most popular ornamental plants in South Korea. It is necessary to develop lily cultivars with high qualities. Therefore, highly efficient propagation systems are needed following release of elite cultivars. In this study, we used taurine treatment to improve the growth conditions including shoot and bulb formation, fresh weight gain, and reduction of rooting and browning. We experimentally evaluated the effect of taurine as a growth stimulator, at concentrations of 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg/l. The results showed that 20 mg of taurine enhanced shoot formation by 85% and increased fresh weight 5.5-fold, which was higher than the approximately four-fold increase in the control. In addition, multiple bulb formation rate was increased by 80% and rooting by 82% following exposure to 20 mg/l of taurine. The efficiency of taurine treatment was higher than that of control with 50% multiple bulb formation rate and 60% rooting rate. The browning was 10.6% at 2.5 mg/l of taurine when compared with 0.8% at 20 mg/l. Taurine showed a positive effect on the overall growth of lily plants in terms of increased fresh weight, shoot formation rate, rooting, and formation of multiple bulbs, indicating that taurine can be used as an alternative to amino acids or as an antioxidant such as citrate and vitamin C in plant tissue culture.","['Pusan National University', 'Konkuk University Glocal Campus']",['South Korea'],"['Kim S.T.', 'Jun T.H.', 'Lee S.-H.', 'Kim J.B.', 'Yang H.-R.', 'Kim Y.C.']","['Browning', 'Lily', 'Mass propagation', 'Regeneration', 'Taurine']",Journal of Plant Biotechnology,Korean Society of Plant Biotechnology,"['Plant Science', 'Biotechnology', 'Agronomy and Crop Science']","['AGRI', 'BIOC']",Article,0,26.0,2012
Upregulation of thiamine (vitamin B1) biosynthesis gene upon stress application in anabaena sp. and nannochloropsis oculata,"© Korean Society for Plant BioTechnology.Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), the active form of thiamine is a cofactor for enzymes involved in central metabolism pathways. However, it is also known to have a role as a stress signaling molecule in response to environmental changes. Anabaena sp. and N. oculata are microorganisms which are abundantly found in Malaysia’s freshwater and marine ecosystem. However, not much studies have been done especially in regards to thiamine biosynthesis. This work aimed to amplify of gene transcripts coding for thiamine biosynthesis enzymes besides looking at the expression of thiamine biosynthesis genes upon stress application. Various stress inducers were applied to the cultures and RNA was extracted at different time points. The first two genes, ThiC and ThiG/Thi4 encoding enzymes of the pyrimidine and thiazole branch respectively in the thiamine biosynthesis pathway were identified and amplified. The expression of the genes were analysed via RT- PCR and the intensity of bands were analysed using ImageJ software. The results showed up to 4-fold increase in the expression of ThiC and ThiG gene transcript as compared to control sample in Anabaena sp. ThiC gene in N. oculata showed an expression of 6-fold higher as compared to control sample. In conclusion, stresses induced the expression of the gene coding for one of the most important enzymes in thiamine biosynthesis pathway. This is an agreement with the hypothesis that overexpression of thiamine is crucial in assisting plants to combat abiotic stresses.",['Universiti Putra Malaysia'],['Malaysia'],"['Balia Yusof Z.N.', 'Zainal Abidin A.A.', 'Fern L.L.']","['Cyanobacteria', 'Gene expression', 'Microalgae', 'Stress', 'Thiamine', 'Vitamin B1']",Journal of Plant Biotechnology,Korean Society of Plant Biotechnology,"['Plant Science', 'Biotechnology', 'Agronomy and Crop Science']","['AGRI', 'BIOC']",Article,6,59.0,2012
Improvement of ex vitro acclimatization of mulberry plantlets by supplement of abscisic acid to the last subculture medium,"© Korean Society for Plant BioTechnology.Mulberry (Morus sp.) of the family Moraceae is very economically important in Asian countries including Korea, because its leaf and fruit have been commercially used in sericulture and horticultural industries. Therefore it is necessary to develop the optimal production system for rapid and cost-effective propagation of mulberry. Our studies focused on establishing an acclimatization method for the successful plantlet production of new cultivar ‘Cheongsu’ which was transferred ex vitro after in vitro culture. In particular, effect of abscisic acid (ABA) addition into the last subculture medium on plantlet response to subsequent ex vitro transfer and its growth was investigated. During acclimatization, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate of ABA-pretreated plantlets were significantly lower than those of non-treated plantlets. Net photosynthetic rate of ABA-pretreated plantlets decreased after ex vitro transfer but increased after 14 days, and it was mostly higher than that of non-treated plantlets. Moreover, relative water content as well as chlorophyll contents and its ratio were also higher in ABA-pretreated plantlets. On the other hand, proline was considerably higher than in control plantlets. After 1 month of ex vitro transfer, survival rate of ABA-pretreated plantlets was 85.6%, which increased by 29.1% in comparison with control (56.5%). More vigorous growth was also observed in ABA-pretreated plantlets. From these results, it was found that application of ABA to the last subculture medium could improve acclimatization and promote survival of mulberry plantlets after ex vitro transfer, inducing water stress tolerance and alleviating abiotic stresses.",['Chungcheongbuk-do Agricultural Research and Extension Services'],['South Korea'],"['Nam S.Y.', 'Lee J.K.', 'Huh Y.S.']","['Abscisic acid', 'Acclimatization', 'Ex vitro transfer', 'Mulberry', 'Water stress']",Journal of Plant Biotechnology,Korean Society of Plant Biotechnology,"['Plant Science', 'Biotechnology', 'Agronomy and Crop Science']","['AGRI', 'BIOC']",Article,5,40.0,2012
Optimization of agrobacterium-mediated transformation procedure for grapevine ‘Kyoho’ with carrot antifreeze protein gene,"© Korean Society for Plant BioTechnology.We report an Agrobacterium-mediated transformation procedure optimized for ‘Kyoho’ that is a major table grapevine cultivar in Korea, and its transgenic plants with antifreeze protein gene of carrot (DcAFP). The full length of DcAFP coding region in accordance with the previous report was isolated from young leaves of carrot and recombined into a plant transformation vector. Ethylene inhibitors such as silver nitrate and aminoethoxyvinylglycin (AVG) supplemented in a co-cultivation medium distinctly increased frequency of shoot regeneration when explants were sub-cultured in a selection medium: particularly ten-fold higher in treatment with 0.1 mg/L AVG than one without ethylene inhibitor. Among various antibiotics and their concentrations, the combination of 150 mg/L cefotaxime plus 150 mg/L ClavamoxTM was selected for elimination of Agrobacterium cells in addition to minimization of adverse effect on shoot regeneration, while 50 mg/L kanamycin monosulfate effectively suppressed regeneration of non-transgenic shoots. Applying the elucidated culture condition, we finally obtained a total of 5 transgenic ‘Kyoho’ plantlets with DcAFP, of which integration with the grapevine genome and transcription was confirmed by nucleic acid analyses.",['Kyungpook National University'],['South Korea'],"['Kim G.H.', 'Kang S.J.', 'Han J.-S.', 'Shin H.Y.', 'Choi C.']","['Agrobacterium overgrowth', 'Antibiotics concentration', 'Cold-tolerance', 'Genotype', 'Vitis vinifera']",Journal of Plant Biotechnology,Korean Society of Plant Biotechnology,"['Plant Science', 'Biotechnology', 'Agronomy and Crop Science']","['AGRI', 'BIOC']",Article,0,31.0,2012
Efficiency of virus elimination in apple calli (cv. Hongro) derived from meristem culture of dormant buds,"© Korean Society for Plant BioTechnology.Various sizes (0.2 ~ 1.2 mm) and developmental stages (referred to as Stage 1 ~ 3) of apical and lateral meristems were excised, together or separately, directly from dormant buds of apple ‘Hongro’. They were mixed infected by Apple scar skin viroid (ASSVd), Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus (ACLSV), Apple stem pitting virus (ASPV) and Apple stem grooving virus (ASGV), which are major viruses attacking apples. A total of 31 callus lines (> 10 mm in diameter) were obtained by culturing the explants on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 3% sucrose, 3.0 mg/L benzyladenine (BA) and 0.1 mg/L indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), and they were subjected to RT- PCR analysis for virus detection. A high rate of virus elimination (expressed as the percentage of calli that did not amplify during RT- PCR, i.e., RT- PCR negative calli per total number of calli obtained) was achieved for ACLSV (100%), ASSVd (93.7%), and ASPV (93.7%), whereas it was only 25.8% for ASGV. ASPV was detected in the presence of 2 ~ 3 bracts. Simultaneous virus elimination of ASSVd, ASPV, ACLSV, and ASGV occurred during the meristem culture, in which the early stages of the dormant buds (Stage 1) were used, because ASGV was mostly eliminated during that stage.

Development of a marker system to discern the flowering type in brassica rapa crops,"© Korean Society for Plant BioTechnology.Flowering is one of the most important development traits related to the production of Brassica rapa crops. After planting, a sudden low temperature triggers premature flowering, which leads to a reduction in the yield and quality of harvested production. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of flowering control is important in the agricultural productivity for preventing Brassica rapa crops. Vernalization is generally known as the main factor of flowering in the Brassica plant. However, in the subspecies of Brassica rapa, some accession such as Yellow sarson and Komatsuna display the flowering phenotype without vernalization. Circadian genes, which diurnally regulate plant physiology, have a role for photoperiodic flowering but are related to the regulation of the vernalizarion mechanism. In this report, the 22 B. rapa accession were divided into two groups, vernalization and non-vernalization, and the sequenced circadian gene, BrPRR1s. Among them, the BrPRR1b gene was found to have deletion regions, which could classify the two groups. The PCR primer was designed to amplify a short band of 422bp in the vernalization type and a long band of 451bp in the non-vernalization type. This primer set was applied to distinguish the flowering types in the 43 B. rapa accession and 4 Brassica genus crop, Broccoli, cabbage, mustard, and rape. The PCR analysis results and flowering time information of each crop demonstrated that the primer set can be used as marker to discern the flowering type in Brassica crops. This marker system can be applied to the B. rapa breeding when selecting the flowering character of new progenies or introducing varieties at an early stage. In addition, these results displayed that the circadian clock genes can be a good strategy for the flowering control of B. rapa crops.",['Rural Development Administration'],['South Korea'],"['Kim J.A.', 'Hong J.K.', 'Lee Y.-H.', 'Kim J.S.', 'Jeong M.-J.', 'Lee S.I.']","['Brassica rapa accession', 'BrPRR1', 'Circardian clock genes', 'Molecular marker', 'Vernalization']",Journal of Plant Biotechnology,Korean Society of Plant Biotechnology,"['Plant Science', 'Biotechnology', 'Agronomy and Crop Science']","['AGRI', 'BIOC']",Article,3,39.0,2012
"Morphological characteristics, chemical and genetic diversity of kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus l.) genotypes","© Korean Society for Plant BioTechnology.The kenaf plant is used widely as food and in traditional folk medicine. This study evaluated the morphological characteristics, functional compounds, and genetic diversity of 32 kenaf cultivars from a worldwide collection. We found significant differences in the functional compounds of leaves from all cultivars, including differences in levels of chlorogenic acid isomer (CAI), chlorogenic acid (CA), kaempferol glucosyl rhamnoside isomer (KGRI), kaempferol rhamnosyl xyloside (KRX), kaemperitrin (KAPT) and total phenols (TPC). The highest TPC, KAPT, CA, and KRX contents were observed in the C22 cultivars. A significant correlation was observed between flowering time and DM yield, seed yield, and four phenolic compounds (KGRI, KRX, CAI, and TPC) (P < 0.01). To assess genetic diversity, we used 80 simple sequence repeats (SSR) primer sets and identified 225 polymorphic loci in the kenaf cultivars. The polymorphism information content and genetic diversity values ranged from 0.11 to 0.79 and 12 to 0.83, with average values of 0.39 and 0.43, respectively. The cluster analysis of the SSR markers showed that the kenaf genotypes could be clearly divided into three clusters based on flowering time. Correlations analysis was conducted for the 80 SSR markers; morphological, chemical and growth traits were found for 15 marker traits (corolla, vein, petal, leaf, stem color, leaf shape, and KGRI content) with significant marker-trait correlations. These results could be used for the selection of kenaf cultivars with improved yield and functional compounds.","['Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute', 'Jangheung Research Institute for Mushroom Industry', 'Suncheon Research Center for Natural Medicines']",['South Korea'],"['Kim J.-B.', 'Kang S.-Y.', 'Lee M.-K.', 'Jeong S.W.', 'Jo Y.D.', 'Kang K.-Y.', 'Kwon S.-J.', 'Kim S.H.', 'Kim D.-G.', 'Kim J.M.', 'Ryu J.', 'Kim S.W.']","['Correlation analysis', 'Kenaf', 'Morphological chracteristics', 'Phenolic compounds', 'SSR markers']",Journal of Plant Biotechnology,Korean Society of Plant Biotechnology,"['Plant Science', 'Biotechnology', 'Agronomy and Crop Science']","['AGRI', 'BIOC']",Article,8,27.0,2012
Identification and characterization of the MYC2 gene in relation to leaf senescence response in hybrid poplar (Populus alba × p. glandulosa),"© Korean Society for Plant BioTechnology.The vegetation period of trees might be prolonged by the delay of the leaf senescence in autumn. Thus, we focused on the generation of senescence-delayed transgenic trees to enhance biomass production. The PagMYC2, a gene containing the basic helix-loop-helix domain, was selected as a candidate for a senescence-delayed transgenic tree. The PagMYC2 gene was specifically induced after treatment with phytohormone jasmonic acid, and upregulated by abiotic stresses such as salinity, osmotic pressure and a low temperature. The constitutive overexpression of the PagMYC2 delayed the leaf senescence and inhibited chlorophyll degradation in the transgenic poplars. Leaf senescence analysis was performed in the leaf tissues of the PagMYC2-over-expression transgenic poplars. The transgenic poplars exhibited higher photochemical efficiency than did a wild type plant under a short-day condition (6 hours light/ 18 hours darkness) or a low temperature condition (15°C) that was similar to the weather conditions of autumn. These results suggest that the PagMYC2 is a useful genetic resource to improve biomass production, which is able to sustain growth with senescence-delayed leaves for a long time in autumn.","['National Institute of Forest Science', 'Kyung Hee University']",['South Korea'],"['Choi Y.-I.', 'Cho J.S.', 'Choi H.', 'Lee H.', 'Bae E.-K.']","['Gene expression', 'Leaf senescence', 'MYC2', 'Transgenic poplar']",Journal of Plant Biotechnology,Korean Society of Plant Biotechnology,"['Plant Science', 'Biotechnology', 'Agronomy and Crop Science']","['AGRI', 'BIOC']",Article,0,43.0,2012
Evaluation of resistance to pierce’s disease among grapevine cultivars by using the culture filtrates produced from xylella fastidiosa,"© Korean Society for Plant BioTechnology.This study investigated whether culture filtrates produced by Xylella fastidiosa can be used to determine the varietal susceptibility to Pierce's disease in grapevines (Vitis spp.) as a substitute for pathogen inoculation or field screening. A bioassay of grape leaves with culture filtrates from the pathogen showed that their phytotoxicities were active and host-selective. Ethyl acetate extracts from them also showed toxicities and host selectivity in both bunches of grapes and muscadine grapes. The sensitive range of plants to the culture filtrates and their ethyl acetate extracts was consistent with the host range of the Pierce’s disease pathogen. Susceptible cultivars are sensitive to even highly diluted culture filtrates, while resistant cultivars were not affected even at their original culture filtrates. Susceptible cultivars were more sensitive to the undiluted culture filtrate than were highly diluted culture filtrates, and the younger leaves were the most sensitive to the culture filtrates in grapes. Although some European grape cultivars showed moderately susceptibility in this study, the determination of varietal resistance to Pierce’s disease by the treatment of culture filtrates of pathogens could provide valuable information for the preliminary selection of genetic resources and seedlings from hybridization in a disease resistant grape breeding program.","['Shanghai Jiao Tong University', 'Seoul National University', 'Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University', 'Yeungnam University']","['South Korea', 'United States', 'China']","['Yun H.K.', 'Lu J.', 'Park M.S.']","['Disease resistance', 'Genetic resources', 'Phytoto-xicity', 'Screening', 'Vitis']",Journal of Plant Biotechnology,Korean Society of Plant Biotechnology,"['Plant Science', 'Biotechnology', 'Agronomy and Crop Science']","['AGRI', 'BIOC']",Article,1,32.0,2012
Genetic diversity and herbicide resistance of 15 echinochloa crus-galli populations to quinclorac in mekong delta of Vietnam and Arkansas of United States,"© Korean Society for Plant BioTechnology.Barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli) is one of the worst weeds in rice (Oryza sativa), but there are few reports about the genetic diversity and herbicide resistance of barnyardgrass in Vietnam. In this study, we used random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis and greenhouse testing to study the genetic diversity and quinclorac resistance levels of 15 Echinochloa crus-galli populations in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, and the state of Arkansas, U.S. The quinclorac resistance of Echinochloa crus-galli populations in Vietnam was confirmed; 9 populations were resistant to quinclorac with R/S ratios ranging from 1.9 to 6.3. Six oligonucleotide primers produced a total of 55 repeatable bands of which 46 were polymorphic (83.3% average) among the 15 populations. Genetic distance was calculated, and cluster analysis separated the 15 populations into 2 main clusters with the genetic distances within the clusters ranging from 0.09 to 0.39. The two main clusters were divided into 7 subclusters, and the quinclorac resistant and susceptible populations were located randomly within each subcluster. Six out of 13 weed populations from Vietnam belonged to one cluster and a single Echinochloa species. The remaining 7 populations were identified as potentially different species in the Echinochloa genus. Nine Echinochloa populations from Vietnam were tested and identified as quinclorac resistant. The connection between quinclorac resistance levels and weed groups defined by RAPD analysis in the study is unclear; the quinclorac resistance of each resistant population could have evolved individually, regardless of differences in genetic diversity and location of the sampled populations.","['Dow AgroSciences B.

The results of study: chopped segments of leaf blades, stipes, rhizomes and roots were cultured on a 1/2MS medium supplemented with 0.1% activated charcoal. Among these explant types, only the rhizome segments produced young sporophyte, regenerating vigorously on a 1/8MS medium. Adjusting the sucrose concentration to 2% and supplement to 50 mg･L-1 NaH2PO4 in the 1/8MS medium proved to be more efficient for plant regeneration. Consequently, the addition of 0.1% activated charcoal to a modified 1/8MS medium (2% sucrose, 50 mg･L-1 NaH2PO4, pH 5.8 and 0.8% agar) yielded the highest sporophyte regeneration.","['Chungbuk National University', 'Ministry of Environment Korea']",['South Korea'],"['Kim S.-Y.', 'Kwon H.J.', 'Shin S.L.', 'Lee C.H.']","['Fern', 'Masspropagation', 'NaH2PO4', 'Pteridophyta', 'Sporophyte']",Journal of Plant Biotechnology,Korean Society of Plant Biotechnology,"['Plant Science', 'Biotechnology', 'Agronomy and Crop Science']","['AGRI', 'BIOC']",Article,0,29.0,2012
Expression pattern of low-temperature-related genes by the treatment of AFP in the cryopreservation of potato shoot tips,"© Korean Society for Plant BioTechnology.The expression profiles of low-temperature-related genes were examined in in vitro potatoes exposed to a cold condition for 1-3 days. The expression levels of PPI1 and CI21B genes were lineraly elevated from day 1 to day 3, while the opposite trend was observed for CBF4 and CI21A. In addition, the expression of the genes CI21A and CI21B varied, along with specific tissues (leaf, stem, and tuber) and the treatment periods. Therefore, potato shoot tips were cryopreserved with LS and PVS2 containing different oncentrations of AFP. It can thus be inferred that the presence of AFP in LS and PVS2 was likely to elevate expression pattern of the genes.

Quantitative trait loci controlling the amino acid content in rice (Oryza sativa l.),"© Korean Society for Plant BioTechnology.The amino acid composition of rice is a major concern of rice breeders because amino acids are among the most important nutrient components in rice. In this study, a genetic map was constructed with a population of 134 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a cross between Dasanbyeo (Tongil-type indica) and TR22183 (temperate japonica), as a means to detect the main and epistatic effect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for the amino acid content (AAC). Using a linkage map which covered a total of 1458 cM based on 239 molecular marker loci, a total of six main-effect QTLs (M- QTLs) was identified for the content of six amino acids that were mapped onto chromosome 3. For all the M- QTLs, the TR22183 allele increased the trait values. The QTL cluster (flanked by id3015453 and id3016090) on chromosome 3 was associated with the content of five amino acids. The phenotypic variation, explained by the individual QTLs located in this cluster, ranged from 10.2 to 12.4%. In addition, 26 epistatic QTLs (Ep- QTLs) were detected and the 25 loci involved in this interaction were distributed on all nine chromosomes.

Development of SNP markers for the identification of apple flesh color based on RNA-Seq data,"© Korean Society for Plant BioTechnology.For comparison of the transcription profiles in apple (Malus domestica L.) cultivars differing in flesh color expression, two cDNA libraries were constructed. Differences in gene expression between red flesh apple cultivar, ‘Redfield’ and white flesh apple cultivar, ‘Granny Smith’ were investigated by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Expressed sequence tag (EST) of clones from the red flesh apple cultivar and white flesh apple cultivar were selected for nucleotide sequence determination and homology searches. High resolution melting (HRM) technique measures temperature induced strand separation of short PCR amplicons, and is able to detect variation as small as one base difference between red flesh apple cultivars and white flesh apple cultivars. We applied high resolution melting (HRM) analysis to discover single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) based on the predicted SNP information derived from the apple EST database.

Genotype analysis of genes involved in increasing grain number per panicle in rice germplasm,"© Korean Society for Plant BioTechnology.ARice is an important staple food in the world and rice yield is one of the main traits for rice breeding. Several genes involved in increasing the yield have been identified through map-based gene cloning within natural variations in rice. These identified genes are good targets for introducing a genetic trait in molecular breeding. Here, we chose five genes reported to be involved in increasing grain number per panicle in rice; Gn1a, dep1, Apo1, Ghd7, and Nal1. We developed In/Del markers for Gn1a, and dep1, Apo1, and applied the reported SNP markers for Ghd7 and Nal1. We were easily able to examine the genotype of each gene on agarose gel. We tested the genotypes on 479 rice resources that we held with evaluated molecular markers. According to the genotype of each gene, rice resources were divided into 13 haplotypes, and most of the Indica and Japonica varieties were included in haplotypes 1 and 13, respectively. When we examined the effect of each gene on grain number per panicle and panicle number per plant, panicle number per plant in the yield negative allele group for each gene was reduced by approximately 0.3 to 0.8 compared to that in the yield positive allele group. However, the number of yield positive alleles for each gene was higher by about 21 to 27 grains per panicle than that of yield negative alleles.

To disclose the underlying mechanism behind the three-dimensional (3-D) growth pattern of magnesium alloy dendrite, an anisotropy function was developed in light of the spherical harmonics and experimental findings. Relevant atomistic simulations based on density functional theory were then performed to determine the anisotropic surface energy along different crystallographic directions, and the corresponding anisotropic strength was quantified via the least-square regression. Results of phase field simulations showed that the proposed anisotropy function could satisfactorily describe the 3-D growth pattern of the α-Mg dendrite observed in the experiments. Our investigations shed great insight into understanding the pattern formation of the hcp magnesium alloy dendrite at an atomic level.","['Ford Motor Company', 'Tsinghua University']","['United States', 'China']","['Guo Z.', 'Du J.', 'Xiong S.', 'Zhang A.', 'Li M.', 'Yang M.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,26,45.0,2017
Synthesis and Structural Analysis of (Imido)vanadium Dichloride Complexes Containing 2-(2′-Benz-imidazolyl)pyridine Ligands: Effect of Al Cocatalyst for Efficient Ethylene (Co)polymerization,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.(Imido)vanadium(V) dichloride complexes containing 2-(2′-benzimidazolyl)-6-methylpyridine ligand (L) of type V(NR)Cl2(L) [R = 1-adamantyl (Ad, 1), C6H5 (2), and 2,6-Me2C6H3 (3)] have been prepared, and their structures were determined by X-ray crystallography as distorted trigonal bipyramidal structures around vanadium. Reactions with ethylene using 1-3 in the presence of methylaluminoxane (MAO) afforded a mixture of oligomer and polymers, and the compositions were affected by the imido ligand employed. By contrast, 1-3 exhibited remarkable catalytic activities for ethylene polymerization in the presence of Me2AlCl; the phenylimido complex (2) exhibited the highest activity [80 100 kg-PE/mol-V·h turn over frequency (TOF, 2 850 000 h-1, 792 s-1)]. The ethylene copolymerizations with norbornene afforded ultrahigh-molecular-weight copolymers with uniform molecular weight distributions and compositions [e.g., Mn = 1.71-2.66 × 106, Mw/Mn = 2.27-2.53]. On the basis of V nuclear magnetic resonance (51V NMR), electron spin resonance, and V K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of the catalyst solution, the observed difference in the catalyst performance in the presence of (between) MAO and Me2AlCl cocatalyst should be due to the formation of different catalytically active species with different oxidation states. Apparent changes in the oxidation state were observed in the (especially in the NMR and XANES) spectra upon addition of Me2AlCl, whereas no significant changes in the spectra were observed in presence of MAO.","['Tokyo Metropolitan University', 'The University of Tokyo', 'Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'International Research Center for Elements Science', 'Osaka University', 'Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute']","['China', 'Japan']","['Mitsudome T.', 'Oshima M.', 'Nomura K.', 'Nagai G.', 'Sun W.-H.', 'Ina T.', 'Hao P.', 'Harakawa H.', 'Takaya H.', 'Tsutsumi K.', 'Yamazoe S.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,28,93.0,2017

Supramolecular Host-Guest Chemistry-Based Folate/Riboflavin Functionalization and Cancer Cell Labeling of Nanoparticles,"© 2017 American Chemical Society.Nanoparticle-based cellular probes are commonly designed via covalent conjugation with affinity biomolecules. Those nanobioconjugates selectively interact with cell surface receptors and induce endocytosis followed by intracellular trafficking. However, this approach requires functional modification of biomolecules that may alter their biochemical activity. Here, we show that supramolecular host-guest chemistry can be utilized as an alternative approach in nanoparticle functionalization and selective cell labeling. We have used cyclodextrin-conjugated quantum dots (QDs) for supramolecular host-guest interaction-based functionalization with folate (QD-folate) and riboflavin (QD-riboflavin), where cyclodextrin acts as a host for the folate/riboflavin guest. We demonstrate that QD-folate and QD-riboflavin selectively label cells that have over-expressed folate/riboflavin receptors and induce the endocytosis pathway similar to covalently conjugated folate-/riboflavin-based nanoprobes. However, labeling is highly sensitive to the molar ratio of folate/riboflavin to cyclodextrin and incubation time. The presented functionalization/labeling approach is unique as it does not require covalent conjugation and may be extended for in vivo targeting application via simultaneous delivery of host and guest molecules.",['Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science'],['India'],"['Dalal C.', 'Pal S.', 'Jana N.R.']",,ACS Omega,American Chemical Society,"['Chemistry (all)', 'Chemical Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'CENG']",Article,9,59.0,2017
An Analytic Approximation to the Density of Twin Primes,"© 2018, University of San Jose-Recoletos. All rights reserved.The highly irregular and rough fluctuations of the twin primes below or equal to a positive integer x (x≤107) are considered in this study. The occurrence of a twin prime on an interval [0,x] is assumed to be random. In particular, we considered the waiting time between arrivals of twin primes as approximated by a geometric distribution which possesses the discrete memory-less property. For large n, the geometric distribution is well-approximated by the exponential distribution. The number of twin primes less or equal to x will then follow the Poisson distribution with the same rate parameter as the exponential distribution. The results are compared with the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture on the frequency of twin primes. We successfully demonstrated that for large n, the proposed model is superior to the H-L conjecture in predicting the frequency of twin primes.","['Agusan del Sur State College of Agriculture and Technology', 'University of Science and Technology of the Philippines']",['Philippines'],"['Regalado D.Y.', 'Azura R.B.']","['inter-arrival time', 'twin primes']",Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal,University of San Jose-Recoletos,['Multidisciplinary'],['MULT'],Article,0,11.0,2018
Ricoeur’s Hermeneutics: Transforming Political Structures into Just Institutions through the Critical Appropriation of Political Power,"© 2018, University of San Jose-Recoletos. All rights reserved.In this paper, I aim to show that the critical appropriation of political power can be a potential tool in transforming political structures into just institutions. To achieve this aim, I employ Ricoeur’s hermeneutics of symbols because in his different political essays, he con-sistently regards political power as akin to a symbol. Thus, for him, the critical appropriation of political power requires a hermeneutical procedure. And so in my discussion, I devote one section for Ricoeur’s hermeneutics of symbols, one for his thoughts on political power, and another one for the critical appropriation of political power through the hermeneutics of symbols. To put Ricoeur’s political and hermeneutical thoughts in a better light, I introduce these sections with a separate section on his philosophical anthropology. In my conclusion, I affirm that transforming political structures into just institutions is very much possible through the critical appropriation of political power. It is such a potential tool in effecting these transformations because the critical appropriation of political power involves a hermeneutical procedure that follows a three-step process of reflection. And reflection, which makes way for the critical appropriation of political power, is what ensures that power rests only in the hands of those who are more likely to advance the common good, resulting into a greater possibility for the transformation of political structures into just institutions.",['Cebu Normal University'],['Philippines'],['Itao A.'],"['hermeneutics', 'political power', 'political vigilance', 'reflectio', 'Ricoeur']",Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal,University of San Jose-Recoletos,['Multidisciplinary'],['MULT'],Article,1,38.0,2018
Socio-Economic Indicators of Coastal Resource Management Participation: The Bataan Case,"© 2018, University of San Jose-Recoletos. All rights reserved.Recognizing the human dimension on participation to environmental conservation initiatives, this study determined the socio-economic characteristics of stakeholders in Bataan Coastal Resource Management (CRM) and how these variables influence their participation in the process. Data were collected through a survey. Four variables revealed to be independent indicators of high or poor CRM participation: the stakeholders’ locality income class, age, level of education, and household size. These indicators are important matters to cogitate for they are indirect drivers of the success or failure of CRM activities. It is concluded that Bataan CRM in the Philippines needs to be reviewed to tackle socio-economic barriers to engagement. Assessment of the process of selecting Bataan CRM participants; strength-ened information, education, and communication component through an enriched content and rationalized delivery; institution of a unified CRM database system; and establishment of a provincial CRM research center are all recommended to counteract stakeholder es-trangement and unresponsiveness to CRM efforts.",['Bataan Peninsula State University'],['Philippines'],['Perdio A.'],"['Bataan', 'coastal resource management', 'coastal zone management', 'environmental management', 'integrated coastal resource management']",Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal,University of San Jose-Recoletos,['Multidisciplinary'],['MULT'],Article,0,20.0,2018

Energy Conservation in Academic Institutions: An Application of Theory of Planned Behavior,"© 2018, University of San Jose-Recoletos. All rights reserved.Energy conservation is a buzzword that cuts across a broad spectrum of stakeholders. It has been widely practiced, developed, and discussed in government, political, and industrial sectors due to its massive impact on tackling issues related to climate change and global warming as well as presenting opportunities to cut energy costs. Despite the active discussion of this topic in the literature, very few papers have discussed it in the context of academic institutions which has one of the most significant impacts in terms of energy consumption. To address the issue, this paper places the topic of energy conservation in the context of academic institutions. Moreover, it adopts the Theory of Planned Behavior to investigate the success of energy conservation initiatives in academic institutions by looking at user behavior and its antecedents. Finally, this paper contributes significantly to the literature as it is one of the very few papers and arguably the first to discuss energy conservation in the context of academic institutions using the Theory of Planned Behavior. Furthermore, this paper will be beneficial for practitioners and other stakeholders in that it provides them with a framework to investigate the success of implementing energy conservation initiatives, especially, in academic institutions by looking at the antecedents of user behavior.",['Cebu Technological University'],['Philippines'],['Ermac E.A.'],"['antecedents of user behavior', 'Energy conservation', 'Theory of planned behavior']",Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal,University of San Jose-Recoletos,['Multidisciplinary'],['MULT'],Article,1,17.0,2018

All rights reserved.Family businesses are increasingly calling attention to entrepreneurs, academics and organizations. This is largely due to their contribution to GDP, as well as being a source of employment. Family enterprises have very peculiar characteristics, such as shared identity, privacy, very close and emotional relationships; however, they also face various problems related to the internal and external barriers in innovation. Among the internal barriers are the excessive risk, lack of trained personnel, high costs, and lack of expert staff; therefore, it has an impact when it comes to innovation, and the organizational culture must be added as a fundamental factor. The objective of the study is to analyze the relationship and influence of the organizational culture with the innovation in the family enterprises in Cajeme, México in order to generate new cultural models.

"Issues Around Aligning Theory, Research and Practice in Social Work Education","© Allucia L. Shokane, Jabulani C. Makhubele and Lisa V. Blitz (eds.) Licensee: AOSIS (Pty) Ltd. All rights reserved.Issues Around Aligning Theory, Research and Practice in Social Work Education provides a reflection on social work education with a slant towards an Afrocentric approach, aiming to facilitate strong reflective thinking and to address local realities about social work education on the African continent as well as in broader global contexts. This volume focuses on issues around aligning theory, research and practice in social work education. A significant contribution is made here to the scholarly understanding of opportunities to sustain the academic discourse on social work education. Social work as a profession and a social science discipline is dynamic, and it ought to meet the challenges of the realities of the societies in which it serves, given the history of the changing society of South Africa from apartheid to democracy. Over the years, social work education and training has undergone tremendous curricular changes with the enactment of the White Paper for Social Welfare and the national review, respectively, by the South African Council for Social Services Professions (SACSSP) and the Council on Higher Education (CHE) for the re-accreditation of all Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) programmes in South Africa fulfilling the prescripts of the Higher Education Act (No. 101 of 1997, as amended) and Social Service Professions Act (No. 110 of 1978). It is worth mentioning that the curricular changes will also continue with the current reviewing of Social Service Professions Act (No. 110 of 1978), as amended, which is underway in South Africa. This book is really ground-breaking! The Afrocentric perspective on social work practice contributes to the current discourse on decolonisation of social work teaching and practice. From a methodological perspective, the book is premised on multi-, inter- and trans-disciplining in social sciences. It covers aspects of social work education and practice through research (narrative, qualitative, African methodology, secondary data analysis, etc.), engendering values and ethics, report writing, supervision in fieldwork as well as exchange programmes and international service-learning, addressing a number of concepts such as cultural competency, cultural awareness and sensitivity are addressed.","['University of Venda', 'Binghamton University State University of New York', 'University of Limpopo']","['United States', 'South Africa']","['Makhubele J.C.', 'Blitz L.V.', 'Shokane A.L.']",,"Issues Around Aligning Theory, Research and Practice in Social Work Education",AOSIS (pty) Ltd,['Social Sciences (all)'],['SOCI'],Book,1,,
Effects of organisational structure on social value: Mediating role of financial performance,"© 2018, Universiti Teknologi Mara. All rights reserved.Social enterprise (SE) is a hybrid organisation, which combine two different goals in their mission and vision. In an attempt to sustain their operation, a social enterprise must ensure that both missions (social and financial) is equally balanced and achievable. The existence of SE is to fill the gap leave behind by traditional profit organisation, non-profit organisations (NPOs) and the government. The aim is to positively impact the social, cultural and environmental issues through their unique business model. Their uniqueness, while can benefit the community and society as a whole is prone to fraud and misuse of funds which would eventually affect the survival of SE. The issues are originated from weak governance particularly the structure of their organisations. Hence, this study aims to examine the relationship between the organisational structure, financial performance and social value of SE in Malaysia. On the other hand, the study also aim to examine the mediating role of financial performance on the relationship between organisational structure and social value. Organisational structure is vital as carefully selected, well designed and well managed organisational structure will improve the impact of social enterprise on the society. This study is based on the 134 data obtained from the SE in Malaysia and registered as Company Limited by Guarantee (CLBG). The selection of a sample of respondents was done using purposive sampling method. Based on multiple regression analysis, the study found that organisational structure and financial performance significantly influence the social value of SE. Furthermore, it was also found that financial performance indeed mediates the relationship between organisational structure and social value. It is hoped that the study can contribute to the improvement of the performance of SE in Malaysia and as well as encourage the development of research in the area of SE.","['Kingston Business School', 'Universiti Teknologi MARA', 'Mercu Buana University']","['United Kingdom', 'Indonesia', 'Malaysia']","['Johari R.J.', 'Utami W.', 'Ghazali A.W.', 'Shafie N.A.', 'Sanusi Z.M.']","['Financial performance', 'Organisational structure', 'Social enterprises', 'Social value']",Management and Accounting Review,Universiti Teknologi Mara,"['Economics and Econometrics', 'Strategy and Management', 'Accounting', 'Finance']","['BUSI', 'ECON']",Article,3,71.0,2018

"Entertainment gratification, informative gratification, web irritation and self-efficacy as motivational factors to online shopping intention","© 2018, Universiti Teknologi Mara. All rights reserved.The Internet technology and pervasive computing has provided consumers with privileges to shop online. In addition, the Industry 4.0 agenda has placed the business web and the social web as the ecosystem domains, which explains why online shopping a norm is today. While many studies have been conducted to investigate the determinants of consumers’ intention to use online shopping, mixed results are always found, especially when businesses take unique approaches for their digital presence. Besides, even though self-efficacy has been studied extensively in information system research, technological complexity has always given a challenge to consumers’ computing ability. Building on the Use and Gratification Theory (GTA) and the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), this study aims to examine the relationships between entertainment gratification, informative gratification, web irritation and self-efficacy towards individual’s intention to use online shopping. Using the quantitative survey approach, data was collected from 217 young executives who are frequent online shoppers. The results of the structural equation modelling suggest entertainment gratification, informative gratification and self-efficacy as factors that derive consumers’ intention to shop online. On the other hand, web irritation has no significant relationship with online shopping intention. The findings do not only capture the importance for web retailers to provide adequate buying-selling information and to provide the element of fun in the shopping portals, but it also suggests that web retailers provide less complicated online shopping features since consumers’ ability to use the technology determines purchase behaviour.

We examine the concept of ""public awareness""by introducing a formal model that analyzes efforts to mitigate climate change in a setting with heterogeneous countries. In the theoretical part we examine the Nash equilibrium of the contribution game. The effects of awareness and economic parameters on mitigation efforts can be disentangled, raising the possibility of linking awareness of climate change with economic wealth. The second part provides some empirical observations and offers the rankings of countries regarding awareness for climate change, as well as an empirical relationship between awareness and economic wealth.","['Sächsische Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Leipzig', 'Uralʹskiĭ Federalʹnyĭ Universitet', 'Southern Methodist University', 'New Economic School']","['United States', 'Russian Federation', 'Germany']","['Weber S.', 'Wiesmeth H.']","['Climate change', 'Diversity', 'Environmental awareness', 'Kyoto Protocol', 'Public goods', 'Regional economics', 'Renewable energies']",Russian Journal of Economics,Non-profit partnership 'Voprosy Ekonomiki',"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)']",['ECON'],Article,2,38.0,2018
Towards a general theory of social and economic development: Evolution of coordination mechanisms,"© 2018 Non-profit partnership ""Voprosy Ekonomiki"".A new approach to understanding social and economic development is proposed, based on consideration of the evolution of coordination mechanisms. The work consists of two parts. In the first part, a critical analysis of four recently proposed theories of social development, focusing on geographical, institutional or cultural factors, is given. These theories have greatly enriched our understanding of the evolution of society, however, as analysis shows, none of them provides a satisfactory description of the driving forces and mechanisms of this evolution; the main reason is rooted in their common deficiency - monocausality. It is proposed to distinguish between two types of development, catching up and leading. The basic ideas of the theory of catching up development are presented. This approach makes it possible to explain the phenomenon of the ""economic miracle""as a result of mutually conditioned changes in culture, institutions, technological progress and well-being in the context of interaction of competition, power and collaboration mechanisms. The second part is devoted to the theory of leading socioeconomic development. It is shown how in Western Europe, as a result of the interaction of the above four factors, specific forms and combinations of the three main mechanisms of coordination - competition, power and collaboration - emerged at each stage of evolution. I emphasize the importance of ideology and the phenomenon of technical progress in the formation of institutions of economic and political competition that contributed to the creation of the welfare state. These changes and economic growth created the conditions for further transformation of civil culture: increasing levels of trust, tolerance, altruism and cosmopolitanism, expanding the planning horizon. The decrease in the level of coercion built into the mechanisms of power and competition are demonstrated as well as the expansion of the role of collaboration. A hypothesis is advanced that the speed of this process depends on geographical factors. The idea of the welfare world is discussed.","['Central Economic and Mathematics Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences', 'Lomonosov Moscow State University']",['Russian Federation'],['Polterovich V.'],"['Civic culture', 'Collaboration', 'Competition', 'Cycle of emancipation', 'Extractive institutions', 'Inclusive institutions', 'Industrial revolution', 'Limited access order', 'Open access order', 'Power', 'Rent', 'Violence', 'Welfare state']",Russian Journal of Economics,Non-profit partnership 'Voprosy Ekonomiki',"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)']",['ECON'],Article,4,78.0,2018
"User education, adjustment factors and use of online databases by postgraduate students in Nigeria","© by Anuoluwa Maria Ajala, Airen Adetimirin, published by De Gruyter 2019.Postgraduate students use online databases for various academic activities. However, past studies have revealed low utilisation of online databases by postgraduate students in Nigeria. The general objective of this study was to examine the influence of user education and adjustment factors (perceived enjoyment and objective usability) on use of online databases by postgraduate students of four private universities in southwest Nigeria. A descriptive survey research design of the correlational type was used, and the population was comprised of 1,067 postgraduate students in four private universities. A sample size of 513 was selected through a purposive sampling technique. Data was collected using a questionnaire and analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Findings revealed varying degrees of usage, perceived enjoyment and objective usability of online databases among the respondents. The study established a significant relationship between: user education and use of online databases; perceived enjoyment and use of online databases; and objective usability and use of online databases. User education, perceived enjoyment and objective usability therefore influenced the use of online databases by the postgraduate students of the four universities.","['University of Ibadan', 'Lead City University']",['Nigeria'],"['Ajala A.M.', 'Adetimirin A.']","['Objective usability', 'online databases', 'perceived enjoyment', 'postgraduate students', 'User education']",Open Information Science,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,['Library and Information Sciences'],['SOCI'],Review,3,24.0,2019
Two-component structure of household income distributions in Poland,"© 2018, Institute of Economic Research. All rights reserved.Research background:Studies of the structures of the income distributions have been performed for about 15 years. They indicate that there is no model which describes the distributions in their whole range. This effect is explained by the existence of different mechanisms yielding to low-medium and high incomes. While more than 97% of the distributions can be described by exponential or log-normal models, high incomes (about 3% or less) are in agreement with the power law. Purpose of the article: The aim of this paper is an analysis of the structure of the household income distributions in Poland. We verify the hypothesis about two-part structure of those distributions by using log-normal and Pareto models. Methods: The studies are based on the households’ budgets microdata for years 2004–2012. The two-component models are used to describe the income distributions. The major parts of the distributions are described by the two parametric log-normal model. The highest incomes are described by the Pareto model. We also investigate the agreement with data of the more complex models, like Dagum, and Singh-Madalla. Findings & Value added: One has showed that two or three parametric models explain from about 95% to more than 99% of income distributions. The poorest agreement with data is for the log-normal model, while the best agreement has been obtained for the Dagum model. However, two-part model: log-normal for low-middle incomes and Pareto model for the highest incomes describes almost the whole range of income distributions very well.",['Szkola Glówna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie'],['Poland'],"['Lukasiewicz P.', 'Karpio K.', 'Orlowski A.']","['Income distribution', 'Pareto model', 'Power law']",Equilibrium.

Decomposition of growth rates for the Russian economy,"© 2018 Non-profit partnership ""Voprosy Ekonomiki"".In this paper, we present a methodology of GDP growth rate decomposition adapted for the Russian economy. We calculated the indicators for structural unemployment (NAWRU) and total factor productivity in Russia. We estimated the structural, foreign trade and cyclicalcomponents of GDP growth rates under various macroeconomic scenarios for the period from 2018 through 2024. The study shows that a significant contribution to growth rates for the period 2018 through 2024 will be made by the sum of the business cycle and random shock component, which, combined with the revitalization of investments in 2017, may indicate the beginning of a new cycle of economic growth in Russia. In the scenarios reviewed, the contribution from the foreign trade component will be negative from 2018 to 2024. The calculations indicate further stagnation of structural growth rates in the Russian economy from 2018 to 2024 at the level of approximately 1.5 p.p. in all of the basic macroeconomic scenarios reviewed. This points to the inexpediency in postponing structural reforms to create conditions for Russia's economy to achieve growth rates that exceed world averages.","['Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration', 'Russian Foreign Trade Academy', 'Gaidar Institute for Economic Policy']",['Russian Federation'],"['Drobyshevsky S.', 'Idrisov G.', 'Sinelnikov-Murylev S.', 'Kaukin A.', 'Pavlov P.']","['Business cycle', 'Economic growth', 'NAWRU', 'Terms of trade', 'Total factor productivity']",Russian Journal of Economics,Non-profit partnership 'Voprosy Ekonomiki',"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)']",['ECON'],Article,3,21.0,2018

Considering the contradiction between suitable pore size and outstanding mechanical properties, this research focused on the topic of preparing the 3D scaffolds with large pore sizes and high interconnectivity. For preparing the silk fibroin 3D scaffold samples, three kinds of porogens were applied in two methods which paraffin spheres were used in freeze-drying. Sodium chloride (NaCl) and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) were used in leaching respectively. Different pore size of porogens were used to control the pore size and porosities of prepared scaffold samples. Some basic properties of scaffold samples were characterized including surface morphology, chemical structure, porosity and mechanical performance. The best porosity of sample reached to 93% in the research.","['The University of Manchester', 'Soochow University']","['China', 'United Kingdom']","['Wang X.', 'Song J.', 'Li J.']","['Paraffin spheres', 'Porous scaffold', 'Silk fibroin', 'Tissue engineering']",Journal of Fiber Bioengineering and Informatics,Global Science Press,"['Computer Science (all)', 'Materials Science (all)']","['MATE', 'COMP']",Article,0,27.0,2018
Force analysis of the support belt and pregnant woman for relieving the pregnancy-related waist pain,"Copyright © 2018 Textile Bioengineering and Informatics SocietyResearching the waist support belt becomes more important. It’s said that the waist support belt can help pregnant women to relieve pregnancy-related pain, but the function of support belt couldn’t be unanimously identified by studies or clinical trials’ confirm at present. In this paper, the force analysis model is established, aiming to detect the role of the waist support belt. Aiming at the dressing effect is not prominent, when pregnant women just wear the waist support belt. In the paper, analyzing the pain causes of the pregnant women’s waist by the theory of mechanics is the basis of research. Through force analysis, it is effective to know how the support belt plays the role. Then, data by pressure test is used to understand the effect, if the support belt can relieve the waist pain of pregnant women. The result is used to verify the results of force analysis.

Exploration and Experimental Research on the Mechanism of Electromagnetic Driven Weft Insertion ?,"© 2018 Global Science Press. All rights reserved.In view of the current situation that there exists big impact and friction between the gripper and the guide in the weft insertion mode of the existing gripper loom, this paper puts forward the idea of the electromagnetic-driven two-way weft insertion on gripper in order to improve the energy conversion efficiency, reduce the friction and mechanical vibration. Electromagnetic drive is used as the basic method to study the projecting/braking of the shuttle, and it uses the principle of electromagnetic levitation as the basic principle of the shuttle’s weft insertion. In this paper, a basic model of two-way insertion is established. After ANSYS simulation and experimental analysis, the speed of electromagnetic driving can reach 30 m/s. In the electromagnetic levitation stage, PWM modulator and DC power regulation were respectively used to conduct the levitation control experiment.

Classification of Female Apparel using Convolutional Neural Network,"Copyright © 2018 Textile Bioengineering and Informatics SocietyWith the vigorous development of clothing e-commerce, the amount of clothing image data on the internet has increased dramatically. A tedious effort was required to manually label and classify the semantic attributes of clothing images. Manual marking is time-consuming and laborious, so a method of automatic classification using convolutional neural networks was studied. In this paper, a female cloth dataset consisting of 10 types of female clothing was built. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was employed to learn the feature vectors for each type. Five different types of architectures, including ResNet50, Inception-v3, and VGG-19, AlexNet, and FashionNet were used for performance comparison. Experimental results have shown that Inception-v3 possesses the highest accuracy (98.07% for training and 96.91% for testing) in clothing classification compared with other methods.","['Donghua University', ""Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China""]",['China'],"['Zhong Y.-Q.', 'Li Q.-Q.', 'Wang X.']","['Convolutional Neural Network', 'Deep Learning', 'Female Clothing Image', 'Image Classification']",Journal of Fiber Bioengineering and Informatics,Global Science Press,"['Computer Science (all)', 'Materials Science (all)']","['MATE', 'COMP']",Article,2,20.0,2018
Effect of washing and drying conditions on dimensional change in various articles of knitted clothing ⋆,"© 2018 Textile Bioengineering and Informatics SocietyWe investigated the effect of washing and drying conditions on dimensional change in various articles of knitted clothing, taking into account drying temperature, temperature change during drying, external force at dehydration, external force during drying, and humidity during drying. We immersed samples in water at 25 ± 2 ◦C for 30 min, then dried them in a chamber at 40, 60, and 80 ◦C, and at 5% relative humidity (RH). We also investigated the effects of increasing the temperature from 40 to 60 ◦C and decreasing it from 60 to 40 ◦C. After dehydration, we dried the samples using a roller and a front-loader washing and drying machine at various humidity levels. We measured dimensional changes in the samples before and after drying. We investigated five samples of knitted clothing: men’s socks, women’s socks, men’s underwear, women’s underwear, and women’s t-shirts. We detected no difference in the dimensional change ratio in the cotton or polyurethane underwear and t-shirts when the drying temperature was varied. However, the dimensional change ratio of acrylic-containing men’s socks varied depending on the drying temperature. When drying acrylic-containing men’s socks from 40 to 60 ◦C, the dimensional change ratio was larger than under other drying conditions. A lower temperature in the final drying stage could effectively reduce the shrinkage of socks made from acrylic, polyester, and polyurethane. The deformation due to external force during dehydration affected dimensional change. The external force during drying also greatly affected dimensional change in the knitted clothing. The humidity and drying time did not affect dimensional change in the knitted cotton clothing.","['Shinshu University', 'Panasonic Corporation']",['Japan'],"['Kim K.O.', 'Hashimoto K.', 'Takatera M.', 'Hashimoto Y.']","['Drying temperature', 'Knitted clothing', 'Knitted fabric', 'Shrinkage']",Journal of Fiber Bioengineering and Informatics,Global Science Press,"['Computer Science (all)', 'Materials Science (all)']","['MATE', 'COMP']",Article,1,15.0,2018
Formation of sects in a religious market,"© 2018 Non-profit partnership ""Voprosy Ekonomiki"".This paper is an extension of the recent work by the authors where a simplifying assumption of no costs of entry to the religious market was set. In the present paper, the religious market is regulated in the sense that a sect in order to establish itself in a market has to bear costs of entry. In the case of one official denomination the strict sect attracts less flock, and the monopoly church will acquire more church-goers and even marginally religious people will hesitate between joining the church and staying nonreligious. In case of prohibitively high costs the sect will shrink to zero and the church will take control over almost all population with the remaining small group of nonbelievers. A comparative statics problem in the case of the two official churches was also considered. In stage one of the game these churches choose their position in the strictness interval with the subsequent emergence of sects. The more costly is entry the less populated will be the strict sect and even the moderate sect will turn more liberal with the loss of some of its members.",['HSE University'],['Russian Federation'],"['Levin M.', 'Bukin K.']","['Non-religious community', 'Religious market', 'Sect', 'Strictness of a denomination']",Russian Journal of Economics,Non-profit partnership 'Voprosy Ekonomiki',"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)']",['ECON'],Article,1,19.0,2018
Glaucon’s Question Ignored Republic 519a-521b,"© 2018, Center for Hellenic Studies. All rights reserved.At Republic 519a-521b, Socrates claims that each guardian must return from his/her contemplation to run Kallipolis. Quite reasonably, Glaucon objects that they would seem to be making the guardian’s life worse than it could be. This objection is often referred to as “the happy philosopher problem”. But rather than answering Glaucon, Socrates admonishes him that their focus is instead on the role of the class of guardians and the happiness of the whole city. It turns out this admonition is the last in a string of similar admonitions that Socrates gives to his interlocutors. This paper examines Socrates’ admonition to Glaucon, and its relation to Socrates’ other warnings to focus on the happiness of the city. By examining these admonitions, we can defend Socrates’ dismissal of Glaucon’s question and the happy philosopher problem at 519d. The paper concludes by examining a strategy for interpreting Socrates’ reluctance to engage Glaucon’s question.",['Berea College'],['United States'],['Butler J.'],,Akropolis,Center for Hellenic Studies,['Classics'],['ARTS'],Article,0,28.0,2018
Democritus on being and ought: Some remarks on the existential side of early greek atomism,"© 2018, Center for Hellenic Studies. All rights reserved.According to Democritus, anthropogeny is a microcosmic consequence within the process of cosmogony. However, we are unfamiliar with that which we in fact are, i.e. ἄτομα καὶ κενόν. This poses an existential problem: we do not know what we are and thus, we do not know what to do. To learn what to do, we first need to understand what we actually are. Physics is predeterminant for ethics. From physics we learn to do that which promotes a harmonious ordering of our atoms. We have to re-shape our atomic structure, we have to create a new nature, and thus achieve cheerfulness. After understanding our Being, we can understand our Ought. Democritus is the first Greek thinker who explains to us what our nature is and who, from our being, derives an ought. His atomism thus implies an existentialism.",,,['Freter B.'],,Akropolis,Center for Hellenic Studies,['Classics'],['ARTS'],Article,0,55.0,2018
Raising an athlete for christ: Saint john chrysostom and education in Byzantium,"© 2018, Center for Hellenic Studies. All rights reserved.This article examines the homily titled Address on Vainglory, and the Right Way for Parents to Bring up their Children, concentrating upon the educational vision it expresses. The text is attributed to John Chrysostom, Christian saint and fourth century Patriarch of Constantinople. Uncertainty regarding the manuscript’s authenticity led to the exclusion of “Address on Vainglory” from most collections of John Chrysostom’s writings, which had seminal influence in a context when the church was united, and the homily has consequently received very limited attention. Chrysostom earned the epithet “The Golden Mouthed” primarily by virtue of his training in rhet-oric and his ability to translate the classical sources that he read into his own, Christian, context. He argues that education must not only cultivate all the faculties of the student’s mind, but also prepare the child to live and act ethically in the world. Chrysostom reconfigures this argument us-ing the striking imagery of an Athlete for Christ, who cultivated not only the faculties of his mind, but also exercised those of the soul.",['Queen’s University'],['Canada'],['Christou T.M.'],"['Byzantium', 'Curriculum', 'History of education', 'Patristics', 'Religion']",Akropolis,Center for Hellenic Studies,['Classics'],['ARTS'],Article,1,13.0,2018

Purpose of the article: The main goal of this article is to verify the research hypothesis stating that in employee–owned companies an increase in the degree of ownership concentration leads to an increase in sales revenues. Methods: The empirical studies were carried out on a sample of 15 employee-owned companies from Mazowieckie Province, which concluded the agreement of giving a state– owned enterprise for use against payment from 2000 to 2004 and using the data from financial statements handed in by these entities to the National Court Register for a ten–year period after the privatisation year. The verification of research hypothesis was based on the estimation of a Cobb–Douglas production function by Ordinary Least Squares method for two variants, differing in the way of measuring the degree of ownership concentration in investigated employee–owned companies. Findings & Value added: The research hypothesis formulated in this paper was verified negatively as the increase in the degree of ownership concentration in employee–owned companies caused the decrease in their sales revenues.

Nicknames among greeks of the archaic and classical periods: Preliminary thoughts of a general theoretical nature1,"© 2018, Center for Hellenic Studies. All rights reserved.This article is the first in a series devoted to nicknames of well-known people in Greece of pre-Hellenistic times. In it general considerations are primarily expressed about the role of nicknames in human societies (including ancient Greek), relations of nicknames to personal names and divine epithets, terminology of nicknames among the Greeks, and the possible reasons for not very broad development of the practice of nicknaming in Greece during this period. A nickname is a fundamental phenomenon of the history of culture, and its real significance has not yet been appreciated. Nicknames in particular served as means of distinguishing individuals within any society. The names of the ancient Greeks had originally resembled nicknames as much as possible. Onomastic units in Greek poleis were mostly meaningful. Nicknames can be assigned—not from a semantic but rather from an emotional point of view— to three basic types. We deal with nicknames of a) a positive, exalted character (“Olympian” as to Pericles); b) a negative, pejorative character (“Coalemos”—“Simpleton” as to Cimon the Elder); c) a neutral character—those that show a certain characteristic appearance of an individual (e.g., “One-Eyed”), or some kind of memorable detail of his biography (Hipponicus the “Ammon” in Athens at the turn of the 6th and 5th centuries BC). Another interesting thing took place in pre-Hellenistic times. Nicknames were more often con-nected not with politicians and state figures but with people from cultural spheres—poets, phi-losophers.",['Russian Academy of Sciences'],['Russian Federation'],['Surikov I.E.'],,Akropolis,Center for Hellenic Studies,['Classics'],['ARTS'],Article,2,57.0,2018

"Using a community vote for wind energy development decision-making in King Island, Tasmania","© 2018 by the Regents of the University of California.In 2012, a large scale wind energy project was proposed for development in King Island, Tasmania, Australia. The project proponents adopted what they described as a 'best practice' approach to community engagement; an approach expected to achieve positive outcomes for developer and community by maximising community involvement in decision-making, limiting social conflict, and enhancing the potential of achieving the social licence to operate. Despite this, the community experience during the time of the proposal was one of conflict and distress, and the proposal was eventually cancelled due to exogenous economic factors. This case study explores a key element of the engagement process-holding a community vote-that caused significant problems for people and process. The vote appeared to be a democratic means to facilitate community empowerment in the decision-making process. However, in this study, we show that the vote resulted in an increase in conflict and polarisation, challenged the legitimacy of the consultative process and credibility of the proponents, and ultimately led to legal actions taken by opponents against the proponent. Factors including voter eligibility, the benchmark for success of the vote, campaigning, and responses to the outcome of the vote are examined to demonstrate the complexity of decision-making for renewable energy and land use change more generally.","['The University of Queensland', 'Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation', 'The Australian National University']",['Australia'],"['Colvin R.M.', 'Lacey J.', 'Witt G.B.']",,Case Studies in the Environment,University of California Press,"['Education', 'Environmental Science (all)', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment']","['SOCI', 'ENVI', 'ENER']",Article,1,27.0,2018
Sales range and innovative activity in the manufacturing system of poland,"© 2018, Institute of Economic Research. All rights reserved.Research background:In the literature, there is a discussion on the importance of the spatial distance from the user in the context innovation activity. However, most of this kind of studies concentrate on exporting enterprises and compare them to domestic ones. Exporting activity is very important for catching-up countries, because of technology transfer in its background. Purpose of the article: The aim of this paper is to determine whether the innovative activity in Poland’s manufacturing system is a consequence of close interactions (local and region-al), or perhaps conditioned by the imperative of functioning on the national and international market. The main hypothesis was that on the current development level of Poland, the relationship between the range of sales and innovation activities are different from those in the more developed countries. Methods: Empirical studies was created in 2006–2012 as a result of the systematic collec-tion of questionnaires filled by manufacturing enterprises in Poland from all regions (5209 correct fulfilled questionnaires). Methodical analysis was based on the theory of probability — probit modeling, because dependent variables were binary (0 or 1). Findings & Value added: Local and regional space is not stimulating innovation activity in opposite to national one. High intensity observed only when the company has been working on the international market. It means that the industry maturity level in Poland is good enough for creating a domestic innovation environment. This kind of an aggregation level should be stimulated by the government innovation policy.",['Uniwersytet Zielonogórski'],['Poland'],['Swiadek A.'],"['Country', 'Innovation', 'Manufacturing', 'Sale range', 'System']",Equilibrium.

Trade interdependence between russia vs. The european union and china within the context of the competitiveness of the Russian economy,"© 2018, Institute of Economic Research. All rights reserved.Research background:The position of a country in the international division of labour is determined by the competitiveness of its trade, the structure of which may both reveal and perpetuate the comparative advantages possessed. This is particularly true for Dutch disease economies such as Russia. Recently, economic literature has seen a growing interest in the topic of Russia’s economic relations with the European Union and China. This article is aimed at being the Author’s contribution to this discussion. Purposes of the article: (1) to discuss the existing trade interdependence between Russia and the EU28, and Russia and China; (2) to try to assess the extent to which the current structure of Russian trade with these two partners corresponds with the competitiveness of the Russian economy. Methods: An in-depth analysis of Russia-EU28 and Russia-China trade interdependencies in 2007–2015 has been conducted, with emphasis on the categories of goods within the spectrum from low-to high-technology, according to the OECD classification. Furthermore, in order to analyse Russia’s competitive profile with regard to the same categories of goods, Balassa’s methodology of revealed comparative advantages has been applied. Findings & Value added: In the recent years, a growing importance of China in Russian trade turnover can be observed, being the effect of dynamic growth of Chinese economy, cooling political relations between Moscow and Brussels and the drop in oil prices in international markets. The existing structure of Russian trade with the EU28 and China seems likely to preserve its traditional competitive advantages in the medium-low-technology goods and oil, which, in turn, will only further exacerbate the negative consequences of the so-called Dutch disease affecting the Russian economy.",['Szkola Glówna Handlowa w Warszawie'],['Poland'],['Falkowski K.'],"['China', 'Competitive advantages', 'Competitiveness', 'European Union', 'Russia', 'Trade interdependence']",Equilibrium.

The impact of the diversification of revenues on ngos’ commercialization: Evidence from poland,"© 2018, Institute of Economic Research. All rights reserved.Research background:The commercialization of non-governmental organizations through undertaking an activity based on the commercial sale of services and products is a phenomenon which raises controversy among numerous researchers. Traditionally, NGOs act in a sector of social services to solve problems, such as homelessness, exclusion or social pathologies. They also provide different services which cannot be provided by the market, for instance in education, the healthcare system, culture, or art. Driven by a social mission, NGOs introduce their concepts, strongly relying on fees to perform their activity. They also obtain funds in the form of public donations or payments from private or institutional do-nors. Growing social needs and changes in the governmental policy aimed at reducing so-cial-aid spending have put pressure on NGOs to develop entrepreneurial strategies to gain financial support. Purpose of the article: The aim of the paper is to investigate how particular funding sources affect the probability of non-governmental organizations’ commercialization. Methods: Data for the analyses have been collected from a national survey of Polish nongovernmental organizations. In the analysis of logistic regression, a specially-developed model was used to estimate the probability of NGOs’ commercialization, depending on the selected categories of funding sources. Findings & Value added: An analysis of the results indicates clearly that the likelihood of NGOs’ commercialization slightly decreases as a greater number of private external financial sources is used. In contrast with existing literature, which claims that government funding is crowding out commercial activity, this research finds that, to some extent, public funds positively stimulate the commercialization of NGOs.

Re-inventing Africa's development: Linking Africa to the Korean development model,"This open access book analyses the development problems of sub-Sahara Africa (SSA) from the eyes of a Korean diplomat with knowledge of the economic growth Korea has experienced in recent decades. The author argues that Africa's development challenges are not due to a lack of resources but a lack of management, presenting an alternative to the traditional view that Africa's problems are caused by a lack of leadership. In exploring an approach based on mind-set and nation-building, rather than unity -which tends to promote individual or party interests rather than the broader country or national interests -the author suggests new solutions for SSA's economic growth, inspired by Korea's successful economic growth model much of which is focused on industrialisation. This book will be of interest to researchers, policymakers, NGOs and governmental bodies in economics, development and politics studying Africa's economic development, and Korea's economic growth model.

Epidemiology of animal bite reported at animal bite clinic during 2015-16 at a tertiary care centre of Himachal Pradesh,"© 2018, Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine. All rights reserved.Background: One health approach for rabies prevention in humans can be done only by targeting the animal source of the virus. Animal bite is the most common mode of transmission of virus to human being. Objective: to describe the epidemiology of animal bite among those attending the animal bite clinic of a tertiary care center of district Kangra, Himachal Pradesh. Methods: This hospital based descriptive study was carried out from March 2015 through February 2016 at Animal Bite Clinic of Department of Community Medicine, Dr. Rajendra Prasad Govt. Medical College, Tanda, Kangra, Himachal Pradesh. A pre-designed and pre-tested closed ended questionnaire was used. World Health Organization’s category of animal bite was used to categorize the patients. Results: Males outnumbered females and around 30% were below 20 years of age followed by third decade. Majority of victims were students (31%) and in 61.1% the wound was localized in the lower extremities. Dog bite was reported in 86% cases. Stray animal bite resulted in 94.2% of category III bites. More than half of the victims were aware of local remedy to be done after bite and practiced it within 30 minutes of bite. Conclusions: Agent, host and environmental factor of animal bite studied in this study indicate that vaccination of animal, abolishing environment favorable for stray animals and awareness of early management of animal bite cases can lead to goal of elimination of rabies.","['Dr. Radhakrishnan Government Medical College', 'Kangra', 'Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri Government Medical College', 'ESIC Medical College and Hospital']",['India'],"['Singh M.', 'Sood A.', 'Minhas A.', 'Bhardwaj A.K.', 'Raj D.']","['Dog bite', 'Prevention', 'Rabies']",Indian Journal of Community Health,Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine,"['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health']",['MEDI'],Article,1,23.0,2018
Absolute quantitation of poly(R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid using spectrofluorometry in recombinant Escherichia coli,"© 2018 The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.Poly(R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (PHB) is a biodegradable natural polymer produced by microorganisms and plants under nitrogen deprivation and physiological stress. Metabolic engineering and synthetic biology approaches are underway to develop strains that can produce PHB and its co-polymers. One of the major limitations to the scaling and success of strain development for biosynthesis of PHB is the absence of fast, accurate, quantitative and scalable methods to estimate PHB in polymer producing cells. In this study, a Nile red-based spectrofluorometric method is developed for absolute quantitation of PHB in recombinant Escherichia coli. The method is a modification of an existing Nile red-based method currently only used for relative quantitation. The two added steps of sonication and ethanol extraction increase the dynamic range of the assay and limit of detection/quantitation. Sonication of PHB standards provides uniform distribution of surface area to volume ratios. This ensures reproducibility and accuracy (lower %relative error) of quantitative staining of granules by Nile red even in a higher dynamic concentration range of 125-1000 μg/ml. Ethanolic extraction of the PHB bound Nile red allows higher recovery and accurate absolute quantitation. To reproduce high recovery and ensure accuracy and precision of the analytical method directly using cells, a protein digestion step was added. This accounted for fluorescence from over-expressed protein and resulted in screening of nonproducers of PHB amongst samples. Thus, the method developed is rapid, accurate, and reproducible, requires low sample volumes and processing compared to other conventional methods. This method is scalable to other PHA's and diverse plastics.",['National Chemical Laboratory India'],['India'],"['Raghunathan A.', 'Ravindranathan S.', 'Rajankar M.P.', 'Rajamohanan P.R.']","['absolute quantitation', 'ethanol extract', 'nile red', 'recombinant Escherichia coli', 'sonication', 'spectrofluorometry']",Biology Methods and Protocols,Oxford University Press,"['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)']","['AGRI', 'BIOC']",Article,5,20.0,2018
An array-based melt curve analysis method for the identification and classification of closely related pathogen strains,"© 2018 The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.PCR-based techniques are widely used to identify disease causing bacterial and viral pathogens, especially in point-of-care or near-patient clinical settings that require rapid results and sample-to-answer workflows. However, such techniques often fail to differentiate between closely related species that have highly variable genomes. Here, a homogenous (closed-tube) pathogen identification and classification method is described that combines PCR amplification, array-based amplicon sequence verification, and real-time detection using an inverse fluorescence fluorescence-resonance energy transfer technique. The amplification is designed to satisfy the inclusivity criteria and create ssDNA amplicons, bearing a nonradiating quencher moiety at the 5-terminus, for all the related species. The array includes fluorescent-labeled probes which preferentially capture the variants of the amplicons and classify them through solid-phase thermal denaturing (melt curve) analysis. Systematic primer and probe design algorithms and empirical validation methods are presented and successfully applied to the challenging example of identification of, and differentiation between, closely related human rhinovirus and human enterovirus strains.",['InSilixa Inc.'],['United States'],"['Gharooni T.', 'Li Y.', 'Zia A.', 'Schoolnik G.', 'Hassibi A.', 'Bolouki S.', 'Van T.', 'Sinha R.', 'Manickam A.', 'Ebert J.', 'Johnson K.A.', 'Anemogiannis A.', 'Mazarei G.', 'Naraghi-Arani P.', 'Kuimelis R.G.', 'Jirage K.', 'Mantina P.', 'Pei L.']","['enterovirus', 'FRET', 'inverse fluorescence', 'melt curve', 'microarray', 'pathogen classification', 'point-of-care', 'quencher', 'rhinovirus']",Biology Methods and Protocols,Oxford University Press,"['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)']","['AGRI', 'BIOC']",Article,0,36.0,2018
Homology-based enzymatic DNA fragment assembly-based illumina sequencing library preparation,"© 2018 The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.The current Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq platforms can generate paired-end reads of up to 2 x 250 bp and 2 x 300 bp in length, respectively. These read lengths may be substantially longer than genomic regions of interest when a DNA sequencing library is prepared through a target enrichment-based approach. A sequencing library preparation method has been developed based on the homology-based enzymatic DNA fragment assembly scheme to allow processing of multiple PCR products within a single read. Target sequences were amplified using locus-specific PCR primers with 8 bp tags, and using the tags, homology-based enzymatic DNA assembly was performed with DNA polymerase, T7 exonuclease and T4 DNA ligase. Short PCR amplicons can hence be assembled into a single molecule, along with sequencing adapters specific to the Illumina platforms. As a proof-of-concept experiment, short PCR amplicons (57-66 bp in length) derived from genomic DNA templates of field pea and containing variable nucleotide locations were assembled and sequenced on the MiSeq platform. The results were validated with other genotyping methods. When 5 PCR amplicons were assembled, 4.3 targeted sequences (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) on average were successfully identified within each read. The utility of this for sequencing of short fragments has consequently been demonstrated.","['La Trobe University', 'AgriBio, Centre for AgriBioscience']",['Australia'],"['Sudheesh S.', 'Shinozuka H.', 'Cogan N.O.I.', 'Shinozuka M.']","['Gibson assembly', 'next-generation sequencing (NGS)', 'single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)', 'synthetic biology', 'target enrichment']",Biology Methods and Protocols,Oxford University Press,"['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)']","['AGRI', 'BIOC']",Article,0,17.0,2018

A cost-effective technique for generating preservable biomass smoke extract and measuring its effect on cell receptor expression in human bronchial epithelial cells,"© 2018 The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.Nearly half of the world's population uses biomass fuel for the purposes of cooking and heating. Smoke derived from biomass increases the risk of the development of lung diseases, including pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, airway tract infections, and lung cancer. Despite the evidence linking biomass smoke exposure to pulmonary disease, only a small number of experimental studies have been conducted on the impact of biomass smoke on airway epithelial cells. This is in part due to the lack of a standard and easily accessible procedure for the preparation of biomass smoke. Here, we describe a cost-effective and reproducible method for the generation of different smoke extracts, in particular, cow dung smoke extract (CDSE) and wood smoke extract (WSE) for use in a range of biological applications. We examined the effect of the biomass smoke extracts on human bronchial epithelial cell expression of a known responder to cigarette smoke exposure (CSE), the platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR). Similar to the treatment with CSE, we observed a dose-dependent increase in PAFR expression on human airway epithelial cells that were exposed to CDSE and WSE. This method provides biomass smoke in a re-usable form for cell and molecular bioscience studies on the pathogenesis of chronic lung disease.","['University of Tasmania', 'The University of Newcastle, Australia']",['Australia'],"['Zosky G.R.', ""O'Toole R.F."", 'Shukla S.D.', 'Rajendra K.C.']","['biomass smoke', 'chronic obstructive pulmonary disease', 'cigarette smoke extract', 'platelet-activating factor receptor']",Biology Methods and Protocols,Oxford University Press,"['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)']","['AGRI', 'BIOC']",Article,3,35.0,2018
From Habits to Rituals: Rituals as Social Habits,"© 2019 by Raffaela Giovagnoli, published by De Gruyter.The present contribution aims at investigating the relationship between habits and rituals; they are based on the same processes even though they have different functions depending on the context (personal or social). Our discussion will mostly focus on the nature and function of rituals, as necessary practices in human and other animals' social lives. After a brief introduction of the notion of ""habit""by reference to relevant studies that cross philosophy and neurobiology, we propose an interpretation of rituals as collective activity, which is based on the same mechanisms of habits formation, but it is expressed in a ""We-form"", from which it is created and institutionalized",['Pontifical Lateran University'],['Italy'],['Giovagnoli R.'],"['Extra-ordinary Communication', 'Habit', 'Habit Learning', 'I-Intentionality', 'Ritual', 'Status-Function', 'Symbolization', 'We-Intentionality']",Open Information Science,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,['Library and Information Sciences'],['SOCI'],Review,9,24.0,2019
"A fast, sensitive and cost-effective method for nucleic acid detection using non-radioactive probes","© 2018 The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.Nucleic acid detection and quantification using a labeled DNA probe is a very common molecular biology procedure. Here, we describe a new method, based on commonly used laboratory solutions, for nucleic acid hybridization and detection with digoxigenin-labeled DNA probes. The protocol described is faster, more sensitive and much cheaper than a standard protocol using commercial solutions. Comparison with a classical radioactive detection method shows that the latter exhibits less background and shows a greater linear response. Hence, the proposed protocol may be routinely performed for qualitative detection of nucleic acid, but when precise signal quantitation needs to be obtained, radioactive probe hybridization associated to phosphorimaging technology is more reliable.","['CNRS Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique', 'Institut Pasteur, Paris', 'Sorbonne Université', 'Sanofi S.A.']",['France'],"['Mosbach V.', 'Marchal A.', 'Richard G.-F.', 'Vaysse-Zinkhofer W.', 'Poggi L.', 'Viterbo D.']","['digoxigenin-labeled probe', 'nucleic acid hybridization', 'nucleic acid quantification']",Biology Methods and Protocols,Oxford University Press,"['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)']","['AGRI', 'BIOC']",Article,6,9.0,2018

All rights reserved.This paper intends to illustrate the monuments of the Periklean building programme, of the mid-late 5th century BC, as overtly formative media in relation to Athenian cultural memory. In essence, it will be argued that the monumental creations of this period embody a configuration of Athenian temporality; organizing synoptic episodes into an ethno-cultural continuum. A required element to this process involves the incitement of landscapes, as the framework into which cultural memory is positioned and incited. This also includes the election of totemic figures, which act simultaneously as emblems of distinct eras and coalescence group memory around heroic events. The provision of those elements necessary for cultural remembering within these monuments, indicate them as affording an overtly formative arena for Athenian collective identity. Moreover, as well as organizing Athenian temporality via narratives of primordial origin, the monuments also display the inclusion of historical, biographical, memory into registers of cultural remembering.",['The Open University'],['United Kingdom'],['Cassell B.S.'],,Akropolis,Center for Hellenic Studies,['Classics'],['ARTS'],Article,2,54.0,2018

Monitoring riverine fish communities through eDNA metabarcoding: Determining optimal sampling strategies along an altitudinal and biodiversity gradient,"© 2018 Pensoft Publishers. All right reserved.Monitoring aquatic biodiversity through DNA extracted from environmental samples (eDNA) combined with high-throughput sequencing, commonly referred to as eDNA metabarcoding, is increasing in popularity within the scientific community. However, sampling strategies, laboratory protocols and analytical pipelines can influence the results of eDNA metabarcoding surveys. While the impact of laboratory protocols and analytical pipelines have been extensively studied, the importance of sampling strategies on eDNA metabarcoding surveys has not received the same attention. To avoid underestimating local biodiversity, adequate sampling strategies (i.e. sampling intensity and spatial sampling replication) need to be implemented. This study evaluated the impact of sampling strategies along an altitudinal and biodiversity gradient in the upper section of the Murrumbidgee River (Murray-Darling Basin, Australia). An eDNA metabarcoding survey was used to determine the local fish biodiversity and evaluate the influence of sampling intensity and spatial sampling replication on the biodiversity estimates. The results show that optimal eDNA sampling strategies varied between sites and indicate that river morphology, species richness and species abundance affect the optimal sampling intensity and spatial sampling replication needed to accurately assess the fish biodiversity. While the generality of the patterns will need to be confirmed through future studies, these findings provide a basis to guide future eDNA metabarcoding surveys in river systems.","['CSIRO Land and Water', 'University of Canberra', 'NSW Department of Primary Industries', 'Conservation Research ACT Government']",['Australia'],"['Bylemans J.', 'Hardy C.M.', 'Gilligan D.M.', 'Beitzel M.', 'Lintermans M.', 'Furlan E.M.', 'Gleeson D.M.']","['EDNA', 'Environmental DNA', 'Fish', 'Metabarcoding', 'Sampling']",Metabarcoding and Metagenomics,Pensoft Publishers,"['Molecular Biology', 'Genetics', 'Animal Science and Zoology', 'Nature and Landscape Conservation']","['AGRI', 'BIOC', 'ENVI']",Article,36,71.0,2018

Transdisciplinarity across two-tiers: The case of applied linguistics and literary studies in U.S. foreign language departments,"© John Benjamins Publishing Company.In the ten years since the Modern Language Association published their report, ""Foreign Languages and Higher Education: New Structures for a Changed World"" (2007) dissatisfaction with the ""two-tiered configuration"" of US foreign language departments has become increasingly vocal. While the target of the criticism is often the curriculum, it has often been noted that programmatic bifurcations mirror institutional hierarchies, e.g. status differences between specialists in literary and cultural studies and experts in applied linguistics and language pedagogy (e.g. Maxim et al., 2013; Allen & Maxim, 2012). This chapter looks at the two-tiered structure of collegiate modern language departments from the perspectives of the transdisciplinary shape-shifters who maneuver within them - scholars working between applied linguistics and literary studies. These individuals must negotiate the methodologies and the institutional positions available to them - in many instances, the latter is what has prompted them to work between fields in the first place. The particular context of US foreign language and literature departments serves as a case study of the lived experiences of doing transdisciplinary work in contexts that are characterized by disciplinary hierarchies and the chapter ends with a call for applied linguistics to consider not only the epistemic, but also the institutional and affective labor needed to sustain transdisciplinary work.",['The University of Arizona'],['United States'],['Warner C.'],"['Applied linguistics', 'Institutional power', 'Literary studies', 'Transdisciplinarity']",AILA Review,John Benjamins Publishing Company,"['Language and Linguistics', 'Linguistics and Language']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,4,35.0,2007

Methodologically, it draws on two decades of multimethod research and knowledge transformation at the interface of applied linguistics and transdisciplinary action research on professional communication (Perrin, 2013). Empirically, it is based on large corpora of data collected in multilingual and multicultural workplaces. First, the article outlines transdisciplinary action research as a theoretical framework that enables researchers and practitioners to collaboratively develop sustainable solutions to real-world problems in which language use in general and text production in particular play a substantial role (Section 1). Then, Progression Analysis is explained as a multimethod approach to investigate text production practices in natural environments such as workplaces (Section 2). Examples from four domains (education, finance, translation, and journalism) illustrate what value transdisciplinary collaboration between academic researchers and practitioners can add to knowledge generation in applied linguistics (Section 3). For the case of journalism in increasingly global contexts, in-depth analyses offer step-by-step understanding of the trajectory from a real-world problem to a sustainable solution (Section 4). The article concludes by suggesting empirically-based measures for research that contribute to the development of both theory and practice in applied linguistics (Section 5).",['ZHAW Zurich University of Applied Sciences'],['Switzerland'],['Perrin D.'],"['Education', 'Finance', 'Journalism', 'Transdisciplinarity', 'Translation']",AILA Review,John Benjamins Publishing Company,"['Language and Linguistics', 'Linguistics and Language']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,6,66.0,1992
The language of numbers Transdisciplinary action research and financial communication,"© John Benjamins Publishing CompanyWider parts of society-at-large are not fluent in the language of numbers, and financial literacy in particular is low in many countries (OECD, 2014). This paper shows how research on financial communication with and for practitioners (Cameron, Frazer, Rampton, & Richardson, 1992, p. 22) can foster intra-lingual translation in the financial sector, which increases financial texts' communicative potential and finally enables laypersons to better understand the language of numbers. Transdisciplinary Action Research (TDA) offers a framework and procedures to approach such goals through close collaboration of scholars and practitioners throughout research projects. Following TDA core concepts, a cyclic process of research and development has been established in the last two decades (e.g. Perrin, this volume; Whitehouse, 2014). Whereas applied linguists involved aimed at better understanding practices of writing and intra-lingual translation at the interface of technical and everyday language, stakeholders from the financial industry wanted to improve their communication. The representatives of society-at-large, finally, were interested in contributing to sustainably increasing financial literacy. In the first part of the present paper, I sketch the suitability of transdisciplinarity in general and TDA in particular in financial communication (Section 1). Then I define the key concepts of intra-lingual translation, communicative potential, and financial literacy (Section 2). Next, I outline the data corpus and explain how TDA was applied in a series of research projects (Section 3). The presented results on a macro-level shed light on the financial analysts' situation and practices in their multilingual workplace: the findings on the micro-level suggest that financial analysts' texts pose a risk of partial communicative failure (Section 4). The article concludes by indicating empirically based measures to develop financial literacy, intra-lingual translation across stakeholders and texts' communicative potential in finance (Section 5).",['ZHAW Zurich University of Applied Sciences'],['Switzerland'],['Whitehouse M.'],"['Communicative potential', 'Financial literacy', 'Intra-lingual translation', 'Transdisciplinarity']",AILA Review,John Benjamins Publishing Company,"['Language and Linguistics', 'Linguistics and Language']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,2,80.0,2014

"Islamophobia without Muslims? The ""contact Hypothesis"" as an Explanation for Anti-Muslim Attitudes - Eastern European Societies in a Comparative Perspective","© 2018 Gert Pickel and Cemal Öztürk, published by Sciendo.Even though Muslim communities are virtually absent in most Eastern European societies new research shows that Islamophobia is more widespread in Eastern Europe than in Western Europe. The existence of 'Islamophobia without Muslims' is surprising prima facie, but in fact this empirical pattern reflects the assumption of the contact hypothesis. In a nutshell, the contact hypothesis argues that an individual's contact with members of an 'outgroup' is conducive to refute existing prejudice and stereotypes. We test the explanatory power of the contact hypothesis on both the individual and the societal level. Empirically, we draw our data from the European Social Survey (2014), which allows us to conduct a systematic comparison of Eastern and Western European societies and to account for other well-established social psychological theories of prejudice and stereotyping (e. g. Social Identity Theory, Integrated Threat Theory). Our empirical results show that people with less or no contact are more prone to Islamophobic attitudes. This pattern is characteristic for Eastern European countries as the sheer absence of Muslim communities in these societies turns out to be a relevant explanation for anti-Muslim prejudice. Eastern European citizens tend to have para-social-contacts with Muslims. In general, they rely on media and statements of (populist) politicians, to build their opinions about Muslims. Negative news coverage fueled by terrorist attacks shapes the prevailing image of all Muslims, media consumption therefore intensifies already existing anti-Muslim sentiments. As a result, Eastern European countries have been comparatively unpopular choices for migrants to settle.","['Universität Leipzig', 'Leuphana Universität Lüneburg']",['Germany'],"['Pickel G.', 'Ozturk C.']","['Contact Hypothesis', 'Eastern Europe', 'Islamophobia', 'Populism', 'Social-psychological Theories']",Journal of Nationalism Memory and Language Politics,Sciendo,"['Linguistics and Language', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'History', 'Cultural Studies']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Review,19,86.0,2018
Influence of business support organizations on innovation activity in manufacturing companies in the masovian voivodeship in poland,"© 2018, Institute of Economic Research. All rights reserved.Research background:The first business support organizations (BSO) appeared in Poland in the 90s of the last century. They were transferred from Western Europe and the United States, where they provided system solutions and played an important role in stimulating innovation activity. However, the latter regions are economically developed, while Poland is playing catch-up. The important question is whether business support organizations will significantly increase the innovative potential of Polish enterprises. Purpose of the article: The purpose of this paper is to probe the impact of business support organizations on innovation activity in Polish industrial companies. It remains to be determined whether enterprises which use BSO services are more likely to engage in innovation activities than enterprises which do not use such services. Methods: To carry out the study, a multi-factor logit regression method was used. In this study, the method allows the determination of the odds ratio for the likely occurrence of innovation activity in companies that used the services of BSOs compared to enterprises that did not do so. The attributes of innovation activity have been singled out in accordance with the international standards of the Oslo methodology. The study was conducted in 2015 for the years 2012–2014 based on a sample of 951 manufacturing companies in the Masovian Voivodeship. Findings & Value added: In the Masovian Voivodeship it is the technological parks and training and consulting centres which have the most advanced degree of influence on the innovation activity of enterprises. The roles of technology incubators, and loan and guarantee funds are also significant. With regard to cooperation on innovation, there is a much better arrangement in sectoral systems, i.e., with suppliers, customers and competitors, than with scientific institutions.",['Uniwersytet Zielonogórski'],['Poland'],['Goraczkowska J.'],"['Business support organization', 'Cooperation', 'Innovation activity', 'Logistic regression', 'Spillover of knowledge']",Equilibrium.

Language teaching and learning as a transdisciplinary endeavour: Multilingualism and epistemological diversity,"© John Benjamins Publishing Company.Language teaching and learning is commonly considered as a research discipline that resides within the field of 'applied linguistics', at least in the way the field is conceptualized by English-speaking academia. However, if we consider language teaching and learning as practice, this fit is not as neat as it at first might appear. Teaching, learning and using an additional language is complex and multifaceted; it involves languages, cultures, learning, communication, identities, etc., which in turn are situated academically within a host of disciplines. Research in language teaching and learning is therefore transdisciplinary in the sense that multiple disciplines can provide different lenses through which to understand the same phenomena and to build new understandings of the object of interest. Moreover, as a field in which languages and cultures are inherently brought into contact, language teaching and learning is also at an intersection between disciplines that are conceptualized and developed differently in different languages and academic traditions. For example, 'language teaching' as a disciplinary area does not map well onto its French translation equivalent 'didactique des langues'. These interactions across academic traditions therefore represent an oftenunacknowledged form of transdisciplinarity. This contribution will examine how language teaching and learning can be informed by a transdisciplinary perspective in both these senses. In particular, it will focus on the idea of language learning from an intercultural perspective to examine how multiple disciplines and different disciplinary traditions contribute to shaping understanding of the field; it will also consider some of the challenges of bringing multiple disciplines to bear on this understanding.",['University of Warwick'],['United Kingdom'],['Liddicoat A.J.'],"['Academic cultures and traditions', 'Applied linguistics', 'Didactique des langues', 'Language teaching and learning', 'Multilingualism in research']",AILA Review,John Benjamins Publishing Company,"['Language and Linguistics', 'Linguistics and Language']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,11,51.0,
Applied linguistics as epistemic assemblage,"© John Benjamins Publishing Company.Any discussion of transdisciplinary applied linguistics needs to engage with three central questions. First, while interdisciplinarity may allow for disciplines to stay in place and engage with each other, transdisciplinarity implies a space beyond or above disciplines. As a result, we have to consider whether applied linguistics is seen as a discipline (in which case it is not transdisciplinary) or whether it is seen as a transdisciplinary field of study (in which case it is not a discipline). Second, while applied linguists may engage with work from other fields - sociology, geography, philosophy, cognitive science are common examples - this does not necessarily mean that we engage with those fields as disciplines. Rather, the engagement with such work is often on the basis that relevant thinkers are engaging themselves with broader epistemic shifts. Such work may therefore be seen as having to do with epistemes rather than disciplines. Third, a focus on transdisciplinarity obscures broader concerns about unequal relations of knowledge production, particularly between North and South. If applied linguistics is to become a responsible field of work, it needs to engage with southern epistemologies. In order to do so, applied linguistic practices can be more usefully understood as temporary assemblages of thought and action that come together at particular moments when language-related concerns need to be addressed. This flexible account helps us see how applied linguistic practices are assemblages of different language-oriented projects, epistemes and matters of concern.",['University of Technology Sydney'],['Australia'],['Pennycook A.'],"['Assemblage', 'Episteme', 'Posthumanism', 'Southern theory', 'The commons']",AILA Review,John Benjamins Publishing Company,"['Language and Linguistics', 'Linguistics and Language']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,29,77.0,
Quantitative solid-phase assay to measure deoxynucleoside triphosphate pools,"© 2018 The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTPs) are the reduced nucleotides used as the building blocks and energy source for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication and maintenance in all living systems. They are present in highly regulated amounts and ratios in the cell, and their balance has been implicated in the most important cell processes, from determining the fidelity of DNA replication to affecting cell fate. Furthermore, many cancer drugs target biosynthetic enzymes in dNTP metabolism, and mutations in genes directly or indirectly affecting these pathways that are the cause of devastating diseases. The accurate and systematic measurement of these pools is key to understanding the mechanisms behind these diseases and their treatment. We present a new method for measuring dNTP pools from biological samples, utilizing the current state-of-the-art polymerase method, modified to a solid-phase setting and optimized for larger scale measurements.","['Helsingin Yliopisto', 'Helsinki University Hospital', 'Sveriges lantbruksuniversitet']","['Finland', 'Sweden']","['Wang L.', 'Suomalainen A.', 'Landoni J.C.']","['analysis', 'dNTP', 'method', 'nucleotide', 'solid-phase']",Biology Methods and Protocols,Oxford University Press,"['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)']","['AGRI', 'BIOC']",Article,7,29.0,2018
Keeping the Engine Running: The Relevance and Predictive Value of Preclinical Models for CAR-T Cell Development,"© 2019 The Author(s).The cellular immunotherapy field has achieved important milestones in the last 30 years towards the treatment of a variety of cancers due to improvements in ex-vivo T cell manufacturing processes, the invention of synthetic T cell receptors, and advances in cellular engineering. Here, we discuss major preclinical models that have been useful for the validation of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies and also promising new models that will fuel future investigations towards success. However, multiple unanswered questions in the CAR-T cell field remain to be addressed that will require innovative preclinical models. Key challenges facing the field include premature immune rejection of universal CAR-T cells and the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment. Immune competent models that accurately recapitulate tumor heterogeneity, the hostile tumor microenvironment, and barriers to CAR-T cell homing, toxicity, and persistence are needed for further advancement of the field.","['VA Medical Center', 'Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy', 'University of Pennsylvania', 'University Hospital', 'University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine']","['United States', 'Switzerland']","['Mason N.J.', 'Migliorini D.', 'Posey A.D.']","['CAR-T cells', 'preclinical models', 'solid tumors', 'translational research']",ILAR Journal,Oxford University Press,"['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)', 'Animal Science and Zoology']","['AGRI', 'BIOC']",Review,6,101.0,2019

Xenotransplantation: Progress along Paths Uncertain from Models to Application,"© 2018 The Author(s) 2018.For more than a century, transplantation of tissues and organs from animals into man, xenotransplantation, has been viewed as a potential way to treat disease. Ironically, interest in xenotransplantation was fueled especially by successful application of allotransplantation, that is, transplantation of human tissue and organs, as a treatment for a variety of diseases, especially organ failure because scarcity of human tissues limited allotransplantation to a fraction of those who could benefit. In principle, use of animals such as pigs as a source of transplants would allow transplantation to exert a vastly greater impact than allotransplantation on medicine and public health. However, biological barriers to xenotransplantation, including immunity of the recipient, incompatibility of biological systems, and transmission of novel infectious agents, are believed to exceed the barriers to allotransplantation and presently to hinder clinical applications. One way potentially to address the barriers to xenotransplantation is by genetic engineering animal sources. The last 2 decades have brought progressive advances in approaches that can be applied to genetic modification of large animals. Application of these approaches to genetic engineering of pigs has contributed to dramatic improvement in the outcome of experimental xenografts in nonhuman primates and have encouraged the development of a new type of xenograft, a reverse xenograft, in which human stem cells are introduced into pigs under conditions that support differentiation and expansion into functional tissues and potentially organs. These advances make it appropriate to consider the potential limitation of genetic engineering and of current models for advancing the clinical applications of xenotransplantation and reverse xenotransplantation.","['University of Michigan, Ann Arbor', 'NC State University']",['United States'],"['Platt J.L.', 'Cascalho M.', 'Piedrahita J.A.']","['adaptive immunity', 'clinical xenotransplantation', 'gene editing', 'innate immunity', 'molecular incompatibility', 'nonhuman primate', 'reverse xenograft', 'transgenic pig', 'xenotransplantation', 'zoonosis']",ILAR Journal,Oxford University Press,"['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)', 'Animal Science and Zoology']","['AGRI', 'BIOC']",Review,15,306.0,2018
Animal Models for Influenza A Virus Infection Incorporating the Involvement of Innate Host Defenses: Enhanced Translational Value of the Porcine Model,"© 2018 The Author(s) 2018.Influenza is a viral respiratory disease having a major impact on public health. Influenza A virus (IAV) usually causes mild transitory disease in humans. However, in specific groups of individuals such as severely obese, the elderly, and individuals with underlying inflammatory conditions, IAV can cause severe illness or death. In this review, relevant small and large animal models for human IAV infection, including the pig, ferret, and mouse, are discussed. The focus is on the pig as a large animal model for human IAV infection as well as on the associated innate immune response. Pigs are natural hosts for the same IAV subtypes as humans, they develop clinical disease mirroring human symptoms, they have similar lung anatomy, and their respiratory physiology and immune responses to IAV infection are remarkably similar to what is observed in humans. The pig model shows high face and target validity for human IAV infection, making it suitable for modeling many aspects of influenza, including increased risk of severe disease and impaired vaccine response due to underlying pathologies such as low-grade inflammation. Comparative analysis of proteins involved in viral pattern recognition, interferon responses, and regulation of interferon-stimulated genes reveals a significantly higher degree of similarity between pig, ferret, and human compared with mice. It is concluded that the pig is a promising animal model displaying substantial human translational value with the ability to provide essential insights into IAV infection, pathogenesis, and immunity.","['USDA ARS Beltsville Human Nutrition Research Center', 'Technical University of Denmark']","['United States', 'Denmark']","['Smith A.D.', 'Heegaard P.M.H.', 'Skovgaard K.', 'Starbaek S.M.R.', 'Jungersen G.', 'Larsen L.E.', 'Brogaard L.', 'Dawson H.D.']","['animal model', 'antiviral', 'inflammation', 'influenza A virus', 'innate immune response', 'microRNA', 'translational value', 'validity']",ILAR Journal,Oxford University Press,"['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)', 'Animal Science and Zoology']","['AGRI', 'BIOC']",Review,14,181.0,2018
Rational Design and in Vivo Characterization of Vaccine Adjuvants,"© 2019 The Author(s).Many different adjuvants are currently being developed for subunit vaccines against a number of pathogens and diseases. Rational design is increasingly used to develop novel vaccine adjuvants, which requires extensive knowledge of, for example, the desired immune responses, target antigen-presenting cell subsets, their localization, and expression of relevant pattern-recognition receptors. The adjuvant mechanism of action and efficacy are usually evaluated in animal models, where mice are by far the most used. In this review, we present methods for assessing adjuvant efficacy and function in animal models: (1) whole-body biodistribution evaluated by using fluorescently and radioactively labeled vaccine components; (2) association and activation of immune cell subsets at the injection site, in the draining lymph node, and the spleen; (4) adaptive immune responses, such as cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, various T-helper cell subsets, and antibody responses, which may be quantitatively evaluated using ELISA, ELISPOT, and immunoplex assays and qualitatively evaluated using flow cytometric and single cell sequencing assays; and (5) effector responses, for example, antigen-specific cytotoxic potential of CD8+ T cells and antibody neutralization assays. While the vaccine-induced immune responses in mice often correlate with the responses induced in humans, there are instances where immune responses detected in mice are not translated to the human situation. We discuss some examples of correlation and discrepancy between mouse and human immune responses and how to understand them.",['Statens Serum Institut'],['Denmark'],"['Schmidt S.T.', 'Pedersen G.K.', 'Christensen D.']","['adjuvant', 'antibody responses', 'biodistribution', 'cell mediated immune responses', 'cytotoxic T cell responses', 'immunogenicity assessment', 'in vivo tracking', 'vaccine']",ILAR Journal,Oxford University Press,"['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)', 'Animal Science and Zoology']","['AGRI', 'BIOC']",Review,5,139.0,2019
Single-round isolation of diverse RNA aptamers from a random sequence pool,"© 2018 The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.Aptamers are oligonucleotide ligands with specific binding affinity to target molecules. Generally, RNA aptamers are selected from an RNA pool with random sequences, using the technique termed SELEX, in which the target-binding RNA molecules are repeatedly isolated and exponentially amplified. Despite several advantages, SELEX often produces uncertain results during the iterative amplifications of the rare target-binding RNA molecules. Here, we develop a non-repeated, primer-less and target immobilization-free isolation method for generating RNA aptamers, which is robust to experimental noise. Uniquely, this method focuses on finding and removal of non-aptamer sequences from the RNA pool by RNase digestion leaving target-bound aptamer molecules, and thus is independent of aptamer types. The undigested RNA sequences remaining are so few in number that they must be mixed with a large excess of a known sequence for further manipulations and this sequence is then removed by restriction digestion followed by high-throughput sequencing analysis to identify aptamers. Using this method, we generated multiple RNA aptamers targeting α-thrombin and TGFβ1 proteins, independently. This method potentially generates thousands of sequences as aptamer candidates, which may enable us to predict a common average sequence or structural property of these aptamers that is different from input RNA.","['RIBOMIC Inc.', 'The University of Tokyo']",['Japan'],"['Nakamura Y.', 'Takahashi M.', 'Imashimizu M.', 'Amano R.']",,Biology Methods and Protocols,Oxford University Press,"['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)']","['AGRI', 'BIOC']",Article,4,56.0,2018
Commemorating the power of democracy: The constructed athenian collective memory of the persian wars through the eyes of aeschylus,"© 2018, Center for Hellenic Studies. All rights reserved.The present paper addresses Aeschylus, and the way he wanted to be remembered by his fellow Athenians and the other Greeks. Living from 525/524 until 456/455 BCE1, Aeschylus experiences the quick transition of his polis from a small city-state to a leading political and military force to be reckoned with throughout the Greek world. The inscription on his gravestone at Gela, Italy, commemorates his military achievements against the Persians, but makes no mention of his enormous theatrical renown. His plays were so respected by the Athenians that after his death, his were the only tragedies allowed to be restaged in subsequent competitions. And yet Aeschylus, when time came to describe himself and the work of his lifetime, mentioned exclusively his contribution to the fight against the Persian Empire as an Athenian. Triggered by the poet’s narrative on the most memorable moment of his life, the present paper seeks to shed some light on the Athenian political identity, emerged during and soon after the Persian Wars, which not only derived from the newly-established democratic constitution of the late sixth century, but also supported it. Aeschylus’ epigram as well as some particular plays of his (the Persae, the Eumenides, and the Suppliants), narrates the confidence, the solidarity and the feeling of equality the Athenian citizens shared with regard to the defence of freedom of their polis as well as of all Greece, which came before anything else in their life, that is above noble descent and wealth. The gravestone of the poet stresses, in other words, how it felt for an Athenian to live during the emergence of the very first Democracy that supported the claim of Athens to become the ruler in the Aegean by establishing its naval “Empire” ideologically upon the commemoration of the victory of the Athenian Democracy against the “tyranny” of Persia at Marathon and Salamis.",['Universität Hamburg'],['Germany'],['Krikona E.'],,Akropolis,Center for Hellenic Studies,['Classics'],['ARTS'],Article,2,75.0,2018
Disaster Planning for Animals in Hazardous Agent Containment Units,"© The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. For permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.Disaster response planning for laboratory animal facilities is a time- and personnel-intensive undertaking. This article outlines numerous considerations in formulating a plan for disaster response in a high containment animal unit. The planning process is discussed around a set of elements: planning team formation, situational understanding, goal and objective determination, plan development, preparation, and rehearsal or implementation. The importance of an appropriate planning team and personnel development is explored in relationship to exemplary disaster scenarios such as natural disaster and terrorism. Specific risks such as hazardous agent and animal species type serve to delineate goal-setting methods. These goals provide the framework for an institutional disaster plan. The review further uses elements of the planning process to explore the difficulties of euthanasia of animals treated with hazardous agents. Ultimately, the pitfalls of handling media relations following disaster are examined. Proactive measures for preparing to speak to the media and mitigate negative perceptions of research are presented.","['NYU Langone Health', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center', 'New York University', 'University of Georgia']",['United States'],"['Harvey S.', 'Roble G.', 'Pullium J.', 'Hester T.']","['animal', 'containment unit', 'disaster response', 'laboratory animal facility', 'review']",ILAR journal,NLM (Medline),['Medicine (all)'],['MEDI'],Article,0,,2018

Applied Institutional Approaches for the Evaluation and Management of Zoonoses in Contemporary Laboratory Animal Research Facilities,"© The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. For permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.Zoonoses, diseases transmitted between animals and humans, have been a concern in laboratory animal medicine for decades. Exposure to zoonotic organisms not only poses health risks to personnel and research animals but may also affect research integrity. Early laboratory animal programs were ineffective at excluding and preventing transmission of zoonotic diseases: the health status of the animals were often unknown, endemic diseases occurred frequently, housing conditions were less controlled, and veterinary care programs were decentralized. Over time, these conditions improved, but despite this, zoonotic diseases remain a contemporary concern. To reduce the incidence of zoonoses, management should perform an accurate risk assessment that takes into account the type of research performed, animal species used, animal sources, and housing conditions. Specific research practices, such as the use of biological materials, can also affect the risk assessment and should be considered. Once identified, the characteristics of significant zoonotic organisms can be examined. In addition, personnel attitudes and training, facility design and management, equipment availability, personal protective equipment used, standard operating procedures, and the institution's vermin control program can impact the risk assessment. The effectiveness of the occupational health and safety program at managing risks of zoonoses should also be examined. Risk assessment, in the context of zoonotic disease prevention, is a complex exercise and is most effective when a team approach is used and includes research, husbandry, veterinary, and biosafety personnel.","['University of Washington', 'University of Georgia']",['United States'],"['Colby L.A.', 'Zitzow L.']","['animal research', 'anthropozoonosis', 'laboratory animal', 'reverse zoonosis', 'review', 'safety', 'zooanthroponosis', 'zoonoses']",ILAR journal,NLM (Medline),"['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)', 'Animal Science and Zoology']","['AGRI', 'BIOC']",Article,3,,2018
Safety Considerations When Working with Humanized Animals,"© The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. For permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.Research using laboratory animals has been revolutionized by the creation of humanized animal models, which are immunodeficient animals engrafted with human cells, tissues, or organs. These animal models provide the research community a unique and promising opportunity to mimic a wide variety of disease conditions in humans, from infectious disease to cancer. A vast majority of these models are humanized mice like those injected with human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells and patient-derived xenografts. With this technology comes the need for the animal research enterprise to understand the inherent and potential risks, such as exposure to bloodborne pathogens, associated with the model development and research applications. Here, we review existing humanized animal models and provide recommendations for their safe use based on regulatory framework and literature. A risk assessment program-from handling the human material to its administration to animals and animal housing-is a necessary initial step in mitigating risks associated with the use of humanized animals in research. Ultimately, establishing institutional policies and guidelines to ensure personnel safety is a legal and ethical responsibility of the research institution as part of the occupational health and safety program and overall animal care and use program.","['Stanford University', 'University of Michigan Medical School']",['United States'],"['Lester P.A.', 'Felt S.A.', 'Vleck S.E.', 'Myers D.D.', 'Villano J.S.']","['animal models', 'biosafety', 'bloodborne pathogens', 'humanized animals', 'occupational health and safety', 'regulations']",ILAR journal,NLM (Medline),['Medicine (all)'],['MEDI'],Article,1,,2018

In research institutions animals can be experimentally infected, acquire naturally occurring infections and can also be exposed to other hazards such as toxic chemicals or radiologic entities. A critical component of the use of animals in a research environment is the collaboration between the responsible researcher and the veterinary diagnostic laboratory with the institutional health and safety professionals to ensure that the proper engineering controls, personal protective equipment, laboratory procedures and training are in place for personnel working with the animals or their specimens. Unlike the typical researcher, the veterinary diagnostic laboratory generally has to be equipped to safely process and work with a wide range of potential hazards where the communication of pertinent information from the researcher to the diagnostic laboratory regarding the identity of the potential hazard is paramount. Diagnostic laboratory design, safety equipment, personal protective equipment, laboratory procedures, occupational health program and personnel training must be sufficient to address hazards based on a risk assessment performed in conjunction with safety professionals.

The use of animal models requires thoughtful consideration for their well-being, as infections can significantly impact the general health of an animal and impair their welfare. Application of the 3Rs-replacement, refinement, and reduction-to animal models using biohazardous agents can improve the scientific merit and animal welfare. Replacement of animal models can use in vitro techniques such as cell culture systems, mathematical models, and engineered tissues or invertebrate animal hosts such as amoeba, worms, fruit flies, and cockroaches. Refinements can use a variety of techniques to more closely monitor the course of disease. These include the use of biomarkers, body temperature, behavioral observations, and clinical scoring systems. Reduction is possible using advanced technologies such as in vivo telemetry and imaging, allowing longitudinal assessment of animals during the course of disease. While there is no single method to universally replace, refine, or reduce animal models, the alternatives and techniques discussed are broadly applicable and they should be considered when infectious disease animal models are developed.","['The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston', 'University of Iowa', 'Colorado State University', 'The University of Alabama at Birmingham', 'University of Missouri']",['United States'],"['Knapek K.J.', 'Kendall L.V.', 'Fink M.', 'Kopanke J.H.', 'Owiny J.R.', 'Dohm E.D.', 'Hansen S.A.', 'Ayers J.D.', 'Lee E.S.']","['alternatives', 'ethogram', 'humane end points', 'imaging', 'in vitro', 'infectious disease', 'reduction', 'refinement', 'replacement', 'score sheet', 'telemetry', 'temperature']",ILAR journal,NLM (Medline),['Medicine (all)'],['MEDI'],Article,14,,2019

The Quantified Animal: Precision Livestock Farming and the Ethical Implications of Objectification,"© 2018, The Author(s).Precision livestock farming (PLF) is the management of livestock using the principles and technology of process engineering. Key to PLF is the dense monitoring of variegated parameters, including animal growth, output of produce (e.g. milk, eggs), diseases, animal behaviour, and the physical environment (e.g. thermal micro-environment, ammonia emissions). While its proponents consider PLF a win-win strategy that combines production efficiency with sustainability goals and animal welfare, critics emphasise, inter alia, the potential interruption of human-animal relationships. This paper discusses the notion that the objectification of animals by PLF influences the developmental pathways of conventional industrial farming. We conduct a conceptual analysis of objectification by comparing discussions in feminist ethics and animal ethics. We find that in animal ethics, objectification includes deontological arguments regarding instrumentalisation, de-animalisation, alienation, commodification and quantification of animals. The focus on socio-political context and relationality connects these debates to central ideas in care ethics. We adopt a care ethics perspective to assess the implications of the objectification of animals in livestock farming. The basic claim is that sensory knowledge symbolised by the farmers’ unity of hand, head and heart would make it harder to objectify animals than abstract and instrumental reasoning where the pursuit of knowledge is intertwined with the pursuit of control, as in mainstream PLF. Despite of what can be considered as a good caring relationship between farmers and animals that is mediated by PLF, people involved in conventional industrial farming still seem to become further detached from farmers and animals, because the PLF system itself is objectifying. PLF redefines the notion of care, in terms of data transparency, standardisation of methods for analysis, real-time collection and processing of data, remote control, and the use of digital platforms. This creates new expectations and requires a redistribution of responsibilities within a wider scope of relations in the value chain.","['Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin', 'Wageningen University &amp; Research']","['Netherlands', 'Germany']","['Bovenkerk B.', 'Feindt P.H.', 'van Dam Y.K.', 'Bos J.M.']","['Animal ethics', 'Care ethics', 'Human-animal relationships', 'Objectification', 'Precision livestock farming']",Food Ethics,Springer International Publishing,"['Philosophy', 'Food Science']","['ARTS', 'AGRI']",Article,43,61.0,2018

Improving the efficiency of gene insertion in a human artificial chromosome vector and its transfer in human-induced pluripotent stem cells,"© 2018 The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.A human artificial chromosome (HAC) vector has potential to overcome the problems of stable gene expression associated with plasmid, transposon, and virus-based vectors, such as insertional mutagenesis, position effect, uncontrollable copy number, unstable gene expression, and DNA size limitation. The main advantages of the HAC are its episomal nature and ability to accommodate DNA inserts of any size. However, HAC vectors have two disadvantages: low efficiency of gene insertion and lack of reports regarding the successful HAC transfer to human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We here provide the first report of a method for the efficient transfer of HAC to human iPSCs for obtaining reproducible experimental results. Moreover, we achieved a 10% increase in the gene insertion efficiency in the HAC vector using our new site-specific recombination systems VCre/VloxP and SCre/SloxP.","['Kazusa DNA Research Institute', 'Chromoresearch Inc.', 'Aichi Medical University']",['Japan'],"['Ikeno M.', 'Ohara O.', 'Suzuki N.', 'Hasegawa Y.', 'Nakayama M.']","['dual RMCE', 'hiPSC', 'Human artificial chromosome (HAC) vector']",Biology Methods and Protocols,Oxford University Press,"['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)']","['AGRI', 'BIOC']",Article,11,30.0,2018
A highly sensitive trap vector system for isolating reporter cells and identification of responsive genes,"© 2018 The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.We devised a versatile vector system for efficient isolation of reporter cells responding to a certain condition of interest. This system combines nontoxic GAL4-UAS and piggyBac transposon systems, allowing application to mammalian cells and improved expression of a fluorescent reporter protein for cell sorting. Case studies under conditions of c-MYC gene induction or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress with thapsigargin on mouse or human cell lines confirmed easy and efficient isolation of responsive reporter cells. Sequence analyses of the integrated loci of the thapsigargin-responsive clones identified responsive genes including BiP and OSBPL9. OSBPL9 is a novel ER stress-responsive gene and we confirmed that endogenous mRNA expression of OSBPL9 is upregulated by thapsigargin, and is repressed by IRE1α inhibitors, 4μ8C and toyocamycin, but not significantly by a PERK inhibitor, GSK2656157. These results demonstrate that this approach can be used to discover novel genes regulated by any stimuli without the need for microarray analysis, and that it can concomitantly produce reporter cells without identification of stimuli-responsive promoter/enhancer elements. Therefore, this system has a variety of benefits for basic and clinical research.","['Waseda University', 'Japan Biological Informatics Consortium', 'Fukushima Medical University']",['Japan'],"['Ishikawa K.', 'Watanabe S.', 'Semba K.', 'Wakabayashi Y.', 'Kobayashi Y.']","['gene mining', 'reporter cell', 'transposon', 'trap vector']",Biology Methods and Protocols,Oxford University Press,"['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)']","['AGRI', 'BIOC']",Article,7,53.0,2018

"Of Mice, Dogs, Pigs, and Men: Choosing the Appropriate Model for Immuno-Oncology Research","© 2018 The Author(s) 2018.The immune system plays dual roles in response to cancer. The host immune system protects against tumor formation via immunosurveillance; however, recognition of the tumor by immune cells also induces sculpting mechanisms leading to a Darwinian selection of tumor cell variants with reduced immunogenicity. Cancer immunoediting is the concept used to describe the complex interplay between tumor cells and the immune system. This concept, commonly referred to as the three E's, is encompassed by 3 distinct phases of elimination, equilibrium, and escape. Despite impressive results in the clinic, cancer immunotherapy still has room for improvement as many patients remain unresponsive to therapy. Moreover, many of the preclinical results obtained in the widely used mouse models of cancer are lost in translation to human patients. To improve the success rate of immuno-oncology research and preclinical testing of immune-based anticancer therapies, using alternative animal models more closely related to humans is a promising approach. Here, we describe 2 of the major alternative model systems: canine (spontaneous) and porcine (experimental) cancer models. Although dogs display a high rate of spontaneous tumor formation, an increased number of genetically modified porcine models exist. We suggest that the optimal immuno-oncology model may depend on the stage of cancer immunoediting in question. In particular, the spontaneous canine tumor models provide a unique platform for evaluating therapies aimed at the escape phase of cancer, while genetically engineered swine allow for elucidation of tumor-immune cell interactions especially during the phases of elimination and equilibrium.","['University of Illinois College of Medicine', 'University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign', 'University of Illinois at Chicago', 'Technical University of Denmark']","['United States', 'Denmark']","['Principe D.R.', 'Jungersen G.', 'Overgaard N.H.', 'Fan T.M.', 'Schachtschneider K.M.', 'Schook L.B.']","['cancer immunoediting', 'canine cancer models', 'comparative oncology', 'immunotherapy', 'porcine cancer models', 'translational immunology']",ILAR Journal,Oxford University Press,"['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)', 'Animal Science and Zoology']","['AGRI', 'BIOC']",Review,38,241.0,2018
Plastics in the circular economy (CE),"© 2021 IOS-PIB.Plastics are used in a great number of applications; therefore, the production of the sector intensively increases. It is estimated that in future, the production of plastics can double by 2035 and almost quadruple by 2050. Still globally, most of the plastic waste is landfilled. Only 9% of plastic waste generated between 1950 and 2015 was recycled. New strategy of European Commission proposes actions designed to make the vision for a more circular plastics economy a reality. The circular economy represents an alternative, more sustainable model to the traditional linear economy. EC has approved new recycling targets for plastics to a minimum of 50% by the end of 2025 and to a minimum of 55% by the end of 2030. Changes that will be introduced in design and production of plastics will contribute to increasing their recycling rates for all key applications. The new strategy will help achieve the priority set by the UE for an energy union with a modern, low-carbon and energy-efficient economy and will make a tangible contribution to reaching the 2030 sustainable development goals.",['Akademia Techniczno - Humanistyczna w Bielsku-Bialej'],['Poland'],['Mrowiec B.'],"['Circular economy', 'Plastic waste', 'Recycling', 'Resource recovery']",Ochrona Srodowiska i Zasobow Naturalnych,De Gruyter Open Ltd,['Environmental Science (all)'],['ENVI'],Article,25,11.0,2021

Earnings management in the private equity divestment process on warsaw stock exchange,"© 2018, Institute of Economic Research. All rights reserved.Research background:Prior studies suggest that companies which go public manage earnings in order to inflate the issue price. However, for private equity funds the use of such activity can be costly in terms of the reputation capital as they are repetitive stock market players. The results of previous research on the effect of private equity fund on the quality of pre-IPO reported earnings are mixed and inconclusive. Purpose of the article: The main aim of the study is to empirically investigate the use of pre-IPO earnings management by private equity funds in the process of divestment conducted on a stock exchange. Methods: I provide comparisons between PE-backed companies and firms with a similar initial market value and growth potential, using the method of single-linkage clustering to build the study sample. In order to assess the scale of pre-IPO earnings management, I apply the discretionary accruals model of Larcker and Richardson [2004]. Findings & Value added: Using a sample of companies conducting IPO on WSE between 2005 and 2015 I do not find evidence that the presence of private equity fund among the shareholders of the company in the period preceding first listing of shares on a stock market constrains the use of earnings management prior to the IPO. The difference between the discretionary accruals in PE-backed and matched companies, when controlling for the market value and book-to-market ratio, is statistically insignificant. To be specific, companies with private equity funds in their shareholder structure do not exhibit lower scale of earnings management prior to the IPO in comparison to other new stock companies.",['University of Lodz'],['Poland'],['Sosnowski T.'],"['Earnings management', 'Initial public offering', 'Private equity']",Equilibrium.

Arcobacter spp. in bovine milk: An emerging pathogen with potential zoonotic risk,"© M. Caruso et al., 2018.The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence and genetic characteristics of Arcobacter spp. in bovine bulk tank milk produced in Apulia Region (Italy). Samples collected from 396 dairy farms, after enrichment in a selective broth, were subjected to an Arcobacter genus - specific Real Time PCR. Positive broths, previously filtered, were seeded on Karmali, MCCD and Columbia Blood Agar plates; presumptive Arcobacter spp. colonies were identified using an amplification and sequencing method and then characterized by Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST). Prevalence of Arcobacter spp. in bovine milk samples was 5% (20/396); A. butzleri was the only isolated species, in agreement with previous studies that reported A. butzleri as the most commonly recovered species in milk and dairy products. MLST analysis of the 20 A. butzleri strains identified 81 alleles and 16 STs. Consistent with previous studies, MLST revealed a high level of heterogeneity between the A. butzleri isolates and confirmed the high discriminatory power of this method and its suitability for epidemiological investigations.

Microbiota analysis and microbiological hazard assessment in poultry carcasses from conventional and antibiotic free farms,"© A. De Cesare et al., 2018.The aim of this study was to assess microbiota and microbiological hazards in poultry carcasses from animals reared in conventional (n=15) and antibiotic free (n=15) farms. An aliquot of neck and breast skin was obtained from each individual carcass at the end of the refrigeration tunnel and submitted to DNA extraction. Total DNA was sequenced in the 16S rRNA and reads analysed with MG-RAST to classify the colonising bacteria up to the genus level and compare each taxonomic group in terms of mean relative frequency of abundance in conventional and antibiotic free carcasses. Firmicutes displayed abundances always higher than 38% but did not show statistically significative differences between conventional and antibiotic free carcasses. On the contrary, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were significantly higher in antibiotic free then conventional carcasses (21.57 vs 10.95%; 19.29 vs 12.05%), whereas Proteobacteria were higher in the latter (33.19 vs 19.52%). The genera significantly higher in antibiotic free than conventional carcasses were Chryseobacterium (10.07 vs 1.94%), Rothia (3.08 vs 0.77%) and Micrococcus (1.12 vs 0.16%), while Shewanella was significantly higher in conventional carcasses (1.38 vs 0.26%). Among Firmicutes, the genera significantly higher in conventional carcasses were Ureibacillus (1.45 vs 0.11%) and Bacillus (3.28 vs 0.56%). The higher abundance of Proteobacteria in conventional carcasses might suggest that hygienic conditions in conventional farms are worse than antibiotic free farms. However, from a food safety point of view, Salmonella was not detected in both kinds of carcasses and the Campylobacter mean relative frequency of abundance was always lower than 0.4%.","['Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna', 'Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Puglia e della Basilicata']",['Italy'],"['Manfreda G.', 'Parisi A.', 'Bianco A.', 'Lucchi A.', 'De Cesare A.', 'Capozzi L.', 'Pasquali F.']","['Antibiotic free farms', 'Conventional farms', 'Microbiological hazards', 'Microbiota', 'Poultry carcasses']",Italian Journal of Food Safety,Page Press Publications,['Food Science'],['AGRI'],Article,2,16.0,2018

Molecular identification of Sarcocystis spp. in cattle: Partial sequencing of cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (COI),"© S. Rubiola et al., 2018.Sarcocystis spp. are protozoan parasites with an obligatory two-host life cycle, with herbivores as intermediate hosts and carnivores as definitive hosts. Cattle are intermediate hosts for several species of Sarcocystis: indeed, in addition to S. cruzi, S. hirsuta and S. hominis, at least four new species were recently identified in bovine muscle: S. bovifelis, S. rommeli, S. bovini and S.heydorni. Since is not possible to unambiguously discriminate between S. hominis and the new species either morphologically or by the analysis of the 18S ribosomial (rRNA) gene, the aim of the present study was to use molecular techniques to discriminate cattle Sarcocystis species, taking advantage of the higher discriminative power of the Cytochrome C Oxidase subunit I mitochondrial (mtDNA COI) gene. Therefore, 119 bovine muscle samples were tested to identify S. hominis-like sarcocystis using a multiplex PCR of the 18S rRNA gene; later, positive samples were tested using a newly designed primer set for the PCR amplification of COI gene. Species identification was achieved by sequencing the amplified products: 16 sequences were confirmed to belong to S. bovifelis, while 12 sequences didn’t constitute the best BLAST match of any of the published sequences, allowing to speculate the possible presence of S. hominis. This study confirms the higher discriminatory power of COI mitochondrial gene; besides, our work provides the first report of S. bovifelis in Italy.",['Università degli Studi di Torino'],['Italy'],"['Chiesa F.', 'Zanet S.', 'Civera T.', 'Rubiola S.']","['Cattle', 'COI gene', 'PCR', 'Sarcocystis']",Italian Journal of Food Safety,Page Press Publications,['Food Science'],['AGRI'],Article,13,14.0,2018

Whole genome sequencing based typing and characterisation of shiga-toxin producing escherichia coli strains belonging to O157 and O26 serotypes and isolated in dairy farms,"© F. Pasquali et al., 2018.In the present study, the genetic relationships as well as the virulome and resistome of newly sequenced O26 and O157 Shiga-toxin producing E. coli (STEC) isolates, collected from dairy farms in Italy, were investigated in comparison to publicly available genomes collected worldwide. The whole genome of Italian isolates was sequenced on Illumina MiSeq Platform. Reads quality control, de novo draft genome assembly, species confirmation and the 7- loci Multi-Locus Sequence Type assignment were performed using INNUca pipeline. Reference-based SNPs calling was performed on O157 and O26 genomes, separately, mapping contigs to high-quality finished genomes. Virulence and antimicrobial resistance determinants were detected in silico using the tool ABRicate. Phylogenetic reconstructions revealed that genomes clustered mainly based on their 7-loci MLST type. The virulome of tested genomes included 190 determinants.

Detection of fish allergen by droplet digital PCR,"© C. Daga et al., 2018.Fish is one of fourteen allergens that must be highlighted on the label within the ingredients list. The European regulation is very restrictive to allergens with zero tolerance. Therefore, it is important to establish sensitive and specific methods for detecting fish allergen. Applicability to detect and quantify fish allergen by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) has been evaluated in this work. Genomic DNA of three species belonging to the most common fish families were analyzed. PCR primers were designed to amplify a 166 bp region of the 18S rRNA gene. Comparative studies were performed to establish the optimal primer and probe concentrations. Annealing temperature was determined by using thermal gradient. The results have shown good applicability of the optimized 18S rRNA gene-method to detect and quantify small amounts of the target in samples analyzed. However, validation studies are needed in order to apply ddPCR technology for routine allergens analysis.",['Institute for Experimental Veterinary Medicine of Sardinia'],['Italy'],"['Daga C.', 'Vodret B.', 'Cau S.', 'Tilocca M.G.', 'Marongiu A.', 'Soro B.']","['Droplet digital PCR', 'Fish allergen', 'Food allergy reaction']",Italian Journal of Food Safety,Page Press Publications,['Food Science'],['AGRI'],Article,7,15.0,2018

Constructing historical justice discourse in lithuanian and russian press in lithuania: The case of holocaust Holokaustas kaip istorinio teisingumo diskurso konstravimo aspektas lietuvos spaudoje lietuvių ir rusų kalbomis,"© Lietuvos mokslų akademija, 2018.World War II in general and Holocaust in particular are important topics of the debate in the Lithuanian public discourse. Due to that the Lithuanian and Russian press is seen by the author not just as a significant source of information, but also as a peculiar tool for structuring knowledge about Lithuania’s historical past. The article reveals that the perception of Holocaust history is changing in the Lithuanian and Russian press in recent years by rethinking of the dominant Lithuanian historical narrative and representing diverse approaches to the role of Lithuanians in collaboration with the Nazi regime. The Holocaust Discourse is constructed as important experience in considering and strengthening the human rights protection discourse in Lithuania as well.

Social construction of nuclear risks: Analysis of institutional communicative discourses on astravets nuclear power plant Branduolinės rizikos socialinis konstravimas: Institucinių komunikacinių diskursų apie astravo atominę elektrinę analizė,"© Lietuvos mokslų akademija, 2018.The paper is located within scholarly fields of risk sociology and nuclear risk communication. It employs the Belarusian Astravets Nuclear Power Plant (BelNPP) case to show how political entities discursively construct the understanding of nuclear risks. The BelNPP is an important case in a broader European region, and especially – for Belarus and Lithuania, due to its debated safety and impacts. The analysis of political institutional communicative discourses, as taking place in the national governments and parliaments in Belarus and Lithuania, was performed as part of the master thesis research. The empirical basis consisted of 132 texts, published during 2012–2017 and defined as official institutional press releases. The theoretical explanatory model included theories of discursive institutionalism, agenda-setting and issue-framing. The results show that the discourse is dominated by the ‘safety’ topic. The Belarusian discourse more frequently communicates BelNPP in a detailed technical manner and dominant frames attenuate the associated risks. The Lithuanian discourse focuses on political aspects and uses issue frames that amplify the socially constructed risk.",['Kaunas University of Technology'],['Lithuania'],['Vilcinskas V.'],"['Astravets Nuclear Power Plant', 'Content analysis', 'Discourse analysis', 'Nuclear risk communication', 'Nvivo']","Filosofija, Sociologija",Lithuanian Academy of Sciences Publishers,"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,2,30.0,2018
Conflict resolution on discrimination: The dichotomy of potential and actual action in Lithuania Konflikto dėl diskriminacijos sprendimo konceptualizavimas: Potencialaus ir aktualaus veiksmo dichotomija Lietuvos atveju,"© Lietuvos mokslų akademija, 2018.The institutional protection of equal rights and opportunities is one of the most important features of the contemporary democratic society. In this context, there is some paradox in Lithuania. The modern mechanism for the protection of equal rights and opportunities is being developed, however, the population does not fully utilize its competences in the case of actual discrimination. The article enquires into the choice of potential and actual actions for a conflict resolution based on discrimination in the context of existing institutional possibilities in Lithuania. The concept of the conflict resolution pyramid is used. Both pyramids of potential and actual conflict resolution represent the trend towards a quantitative decline in the choices to be made for the conflict resolution. Some foreseen gaps between the potential and actual action in the case of discrimination are unexpectedly salient. Almost all Lithuanians express the determination to defend the violated rights that is not a case of represented actual actions by the victims of discrimination. Moreover, it can be assumed that at least half of all Lithuanian respondents are not eager for the conflict resolution even on the basic level of a close social environment. Also, the research data suggest that the public discourse on equal opportunities and discrimination is at the stage of formation.",['Lietuvos socialinių tyrimų centras'],['Lithuania'],"['Zvinkliene A.', 'Kublickiene L.']","['Conflict resolution pyramid', 'Discrimination', 'Equal rights and opportunities']","Filosofija, Sociologija",Lithuanian Academy of Sciences Publishers,"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,15.0,2018
"RNA profile diversity across arthropoda: Guidelines, methodological artifacts, and expected outcomes","© 2018 The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.High-quality RNA is an important precursor for high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and subsequent analyses. However, the primary metric used to assess RNA quality, the RNA Integrity Number (RIN), was developed based on model bacterial and vertebrate organisms. Though the phenomenon is not widely recognized, invertebrate 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is highly prone to a form of denaturation known as gap deletion, in which the subunit collapses into two smaller fragments. In many nonmodel invertebrates, this collapse of the 28S subunit appears as a single band similar in size to the 18S rRNA subunit. This phenomenon is hypothesized to be commonplace among arthropods and is often misinterpreted as a ""degraded"" rRNA profile. The limited characterization of gap deletion in arthropods, a highly diverse group, as well as other nonmodel invertebrates, often biases RNA quality assessments. To test whether the collapse of 28S is a general pattern or a methodological artifact, we sampled more than half of the major lineages within Arthropoda. We found that the 28S collapse is present in ∼90% of the species sampled. Nevertheless, RNA profiles exhibit considerable diversity with a range of banding patterns. High-throughput RNAseq and subsequent assembly of high-quality transcriptomes from select arthropod species exhibiting collapsed 28S subunits further illustrates the limitations of current RIN proxies in accurately characterizing RNA quality in nonmodel organisms. Furthermore, we show that this form of 28S denaturation, which is often mistaken for true ""degradation,"" can occur at relatively low temperatures.",['Florida International University'],['United States'],"['Perez-Moreno J.L.', 'Vazquez-Miranda H.', 'Bracken-Grissom H.D.', 'Deleo D.M.']","['crustaceans', 'denaturation', 'gap deletion', 'genomics', 'insects', 'invertebrates', 'nucleic acids', 'RNAseq', 'transcriptomics']",Biology Methods and Protocols,Oxford University Press,"['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)']","['AGRI', 'BIOC']",Article,12,48.0,2018
We do not need this chaos: Attitudes of the lithuanian people towards refugees „Šito chaoso mums nereikia“: Lietuvos gyventojų požiūris į pabėgėlius,"© Lietuvos mokslų akademija, 2018.This article analyses attitudes of the Lithuanian people towards refugees, and is based on the empirical research carried out at the Institute of Sociology, Lithuanian Social Research Centre, in 2016. Taking into consideration the results of the previous research on the factors that determine the attitudes towards refugees, this article looks at the peculiarities of the attitudes of the Lithuanian people. The article argues that people are very sceptical and concerned about refugees coming to Lithuania and, in particular, tend to place first the negative consequences of migration.

Power and representation in women’s autobiographies Galia ir atstovavimas moterų autobiografijose,"© Lietuvos mokslų akademija, 2018.The study discusses epistemological aspects of power and the dynamics of its perception in the process of life-writing. Autobiography is presented as a specific form of epiphany. The paper suggests that writing one’s own life enables the author to better understand the past. As a result of a retrospective self-analysis the writer shapes a new look at the borders of his/her personal power and the level of its dependence on others. In investigation of life-writings, a qualitative method of social sciences in combination with hermeneutics, close reading and discourse analysis reveal deep and hidden social norms, gender roles, religion, and their role in empowerment and disempowerment of the author. The study consists of two parts. The first part is theoretical and interrogates the notion of personal power. It finds links between writing the own life and conscious empowerment, arguing that the author becomes more conscious about the own personality after having analysed the past decisions from the perspective of present times. The second part presents two autobiographies by female authors from two different Muslim cultures. These authors negotiate between the larger nationalist agenda and their own personal concerns. These autobiographies (Pakistani author Tehmina Durrani, My Feudal Lord; Azerbaijani writer Banine, Caucasian Days and Parisian Days) are the end of their authors’ long silence, their revolt against the conventional norms, their decision to have an agency to confess and protest. These autobiographies are the authors’ attempts to break the established matrix of perceptions, imposed norms, and gain power to build the real picture of their identity. The study sums up with the conclusion that in spite of very similar motifs of female authors to get empowered through self-analysis, different cultures and time create specific subjectivities associated with particular historical events and geographical location.",['Bakı Mühəndislik Universiteti'],['Azerbaijan'],['Dadashova S.'],"['Banine', 'Conformity level', 'Empowerment', 'Female autobiography', 'Self-identity', 'Tehmina Durrani']","Filosofija, Sociologija",Lithuanian Academy of Sciences Publishers,"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,12.0,2018
Aspects of social justice in the civic participation of russian ethnic group in lithuania Socialinio teisingumo aspektai rusų etninės grupės pilietinėje veikloje lietuvoje1,"© Lietuvos mokslų akademija, 2018.The article presents empirical data from qualitative interviews with leaders and representatives of Russian ethnic group nongovernmental organizations conducted in the cities of Vilnius, Klaipėda and Kaunas in 2016–2017. The analysis of aspects of social justice in civic participation of the Russian ethnic minority group is presented in the article. The author applies the definition of Nancy Fraser (1996, 2007), who distinguishes three dimensions of social justice: economic, cultural and political, associated with redistribution, recognition policy and political representation. It is discussed if and how the motives, goals and activities of the Russian nongovernmental organizations are linked or related to these mentioned dimensions. The study revealed that the field of activity of the Russian nongovernmental organizations mainly focuses on cultural activities and cultural aspects related to the policy of recognition of ethnic groups. The empirical data is collected in the framework of the research project which addresses the experiences of social and historical justice by different generations of Lithuanians and Lithuanian Russians.

The current funding period for 2014–2020 is not covered. During each period, different goals were raised. The first period was dedicated for infrastructure projects which was important to provide the basis for further development. Mostly social service centers, pre-primary education institutions, elderly care centers, schools and other social service infrastructure have been improved or developed. During the second financing period, the aim of projects was to develop social dialogue, services and service quality assurance, life-long education and human resources. Because of the absence of knowledge how EU-funded projects are distributed by Lithuanian municipalities this article attempts to answer this question. This article presents the distribution of EU-funded social policy projects in Lithuanian municipalities. All projects are quantitatively mapped. The analysis of the maps divides municipalities into five categories according to the number of implemented projects. During the first funding period, projects were unevenly distributed in municipalities, but the gap between the major cities of Lithuania was quite proportional to the size of municipalities. During the second funding period, Vilnius and Kaunas municipalities increased the number of realised projects by four and five times, respectively. For the whole period 2004–2013, the largest potential of EU-funded projects was realised in the two major cities of Lithuania, Vilnius and Kaunas, with a disproportionate gap between them and both the third largest city and other municipalities.",['Lietuvos socialinių tyrimų centras'],['Lithuania'],['Uselyte-Kravcionok M.'],"['European Union', 'Lithuanian social policy', 'Social policy']","Filosofija, Sociologija",Lithuanian Academy of Sciences Publishers,"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,14.0,2018

It begins with introducing the theoretical background of Foucault’s confessing society concept. The concept explores the functional relationship between academic discourse and confession the aim of which is to acquire data, information and knowledge about the characteristics and states of the subjects. The second part of the paper presents the results of the analysis of ‘the practices of confession’ in the current academic discourse in Poland. The empirical material comprises texts published in the monthly periodical Forum Akademickie. The studies provided answers to four fundamental questions: Who confesses? What is the object of confession? What is the form of the confession? Who/what encourages the confession? In conclusion, the authors reflect on what kind of ‘truth’ about the university is produced by academic confessions. The study shows that academic discourse co-creates the ‘culture of confession’ in public statements about the Academics’ biographies, choices and career plans, by revealing the ‘secrets’ of scientific work.

The main objective is to reveal how different societal groups perceive the political, administrative and community experience of the mayor determining the complex profiles of local political leadership and role in local communities. The theoretical discussion is complemented with the results of the representative public opinion survey of Lithuanian inhabitants performed in February–March 2016. The empirical results reveal different perceptions of the mayor image which is more based on the ‘manage-rial’ leadership style rather than considering him as a politician. The relationships with the local community are perceived as less significant which also reveals the weak identification within local issues and fragmented social interactions with a variety of interest groups.

The answers to these questions inevitably lead to the fundamental issue of personal identity. The present article analyses one of the aspects of the place identity phenomenon, namely, the dynamics of the relationship of self-perception of Lithuanians with certain places. For this purpose, the latest data from the European Values Survey, completed at the end of 2017, and the data of previous waves of this survey are employed. They reveal that Lithuanians give priority to local areas (first of all, to their own city, to Lithuania, and somewhat less to their own region), meanwhile their identification with Europe and the whole world is not so strong. However, the empirical data confirm the theoretical assumption that local and global self-awareness cannot be opposed: the comparison of the strength of place identities in different socio-de-mographic groups and among respondents with different value orientations has shown that the boundaries of places important for a person’s self-awareness are intertwined in a very complex way.",['Lietuvos kultūros tyrimų institutas'],['Lithuania'],['Savicka A.'],"['Eurointegration', 'Globality', 'Locality', 'Place attachment', 'Place identity']","Filosofija, Sociologija",Lithuanian Academy of Sciences Publishers,"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,19.0,2018
A novel de novo paracentric inversion [inv(20)(q13.1q13.3)] accompanied by an 11q14.3-q21 microdeletion in a pediatric patient with an intellectual disability,"© 2018 Zachaki S, Kouvidi E, Mitrakos A, Lazaros L, Pantou A, Mavrou A, Tzetis M, Manola KN published by Sciendo 2018.A novel de novo paracentric inversion of the long arm of chromosome 20 [inv(20)(q13.1q13.3)], detected by conventional karyotyping in a 14-year-old boy with mental retardation is described. Further investigation by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) revealed that the 20q inversion was not accompanied by microdeletions/microduplications containing disease-associated genes near or at the breakpoints. Two deletions at chromosomal regions 11q14.3q21 and 20q12 of 4.5 and 1.97 Mb size, respectively, containing important online Mendelian inheritance in man (OMIM) genes, were detected. The 4.5Mb 11q14.3q21 microdeletion was contained within a region that is involved, in most of the reported cases, with the interstitial 11q deletion and may be related to the mental retardation and developmental delay present in the patient. On the other hand, the published data about the 20q12 microdeletion are very few and it is not possible to correlate this finding with our patient's phenotype. This case report contributes to the description of a new chromosomal entity, not previously reported, and is therefore important, especially in prenatal diagnosis and management of patients. Array comparative genomic hybridization has proven a useful technique for detecting submicroscopic rearrangements and should be offered prenatally, especially in cases of de novo karyotypically balanced chromosomal inversions or translocations in order to unveil other unbalanced chromosomal abnormalities such as deletions and amplifications.","['School of Medicine', 'National Centre for Scientific Research ""DEMOKRITOS""', 'Clinical Genetics &amp; Research']",['Greece'],"['Lazaros L.', 'Manola Kn.', 'Kouvidi E.', 'Mitrakos A.', 'Pantou A.', 'Zachaki S.', 'Mavrou A.', 'Tzetis M.']","['Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH)', 'G-banding', 'Microdeletion', 'Microduplication', 'Paracentric inversion (PAI)']",Balkan Journal of Medical Genetics,Sciendo,"['Genetics', 'Genetics (clinical)']","['BIOC', 'MEDI']",Article,1,20.0,2018
A familial case report of a 13;22 chromosomal translocation with recurrent intracytoplasmic sperm injection failure,"© 2018 Verma S, Shah R, Bhat A, Bhat GR, Dada R, Kumar R published by Sciendo 2018.The importance of cytogenetic analysis in a family with reproductive failure in two siblings is highlighted, where two siblings and their mother presented with a balanced translocation between chromosomes 13;22. The clinical evaluation had shown the female to be normal and the male to be oligoasthenoteratozoospermic despite repeated semen analysis. The couple was referred to our laboratory after three consecutive intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) failures at a local assisted reproductive technique (ART) center. Peripheral blood lymphocytes, obtained for karyotyping, were studied by a standard G-banding technique. Chromosomal analysis of the members of the pedigree, including the probands, showed the presence of the same translocation, t(13;22)(q21.2;q13.3), carried by three generations of the family. The sister and the mother of the proband had multiple spontaneous abortions in the first trimester. The spouses, when examined cytogenetically, were found to be normal. We propose the involvement of a balanced t(13;22)(q21.2;q13.3) chromosomal translocation in the pathogenesis of recurrent ART or spontaneous reproductive failures. Hence, it is suggested that all cases with structural chromosomal abnormalities be counseled prior to opting for ART and undergoing pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). This would prevent recurrent financial, physical and emotional stress in couples seeking ART.","['All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi', 'Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University']",['India'],"['Dada R.', 'Shah R.', 'Bhat A.', 'Bhat Gr.', 'Verma S.', 'Kumar R.']","['Assisted reproductive technique (ART) center', 'In vitro fertilization (IVF)', 'Infertility', 'Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)', 'Karyotyping', 'Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD)', 'Spontaneous abortions', 'Translocation']",Balkan Journal of Medical Genetics,Sciendo,"['Genetics', 'Genetics (clinical)']","['BIOC', 'MEDI']",Article,1,33.0,2018
Investigation of circulating serum microRNA-328-3p and microRNA-3135a expression as promising novel biomarkers for autism spectrum disorder,"© 2018 Popov NT, Minchev DS, Naydenov MM, Minkov IN, Vachev TI, published by Sciendo.Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as promising diagnostic biomarkers for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but their usefulness for detecting ASD remains unclear. Nowadays, development of promising biomarkers for ASD remains a challenge. Recently, dysregulation of the miRNAs expression in postmortem brain tissue, serum and peripheral blood, have been associated with ASD. Circulating miRNAs are known to be secreted by a number of different cells and can interpose delivery of information into receiver cells, thus affecting their functions. Based on this fact, it is supposed that serum miRNAs could be a novel class of biomarkers for prognosis or diagnosis of pathological disorders including ASD. In the current research, we investigated whether the expression patterns of circulating miRNAs showed dysregulation in subjects diagnosed with ASD. Expression levels of serum miR-328-3p and miR-3135a were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) method of subjects diagnosed with ASD in comparison with healthy control subjects. Our data showed that miR-328-3p and miR-3135a were substantially down-regulated in ASD patients than in those of healthy control subjects. Moreover, target gene analysis of altered serum miRNAs displayed that these molecules targeted 162 genes denoted as unique validated targets in the miRWalk database, 71 of which appear to participate in biological pathways involved in synaptic pathways and neurodegenerative condition such as Alzheimer, Huntington and Parkinson diseases. Finally, the results strongly suggested that dys-regulated serum miRNAs might be involved in molecular pathways associated with ASD and miR-328-3p and miR-3135a have the potential to be promising novel biomarkers for ASD.","['Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology', 'State Psychiatry Hospital Pazardzhik', 'Paisii Hilendarski University of Plovdiv']",['Bulgaria'],"['Mm N.', 'Ti V.', 'Ds M.', 'In M.', 'Nt P.']","['Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)', 'MicroRNA (miRNA) expression profiling', 'Serum miRNAs', 'Stem-loop quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)']",Balkan Journal of Medical Genetics,Sciendo,"['Genetics', 'Genetics (clinical)']","['BIOC', 'MEDI']",Article,14,35.0,2018
Myotonic dystrophy-2: Unusual phenotype due to a small CCTG-expansion,"© 2018 Finsterer J, Stöllberger C, Reining-Festa A, Loewe-Grgurin M, Gencik M, published by Sciendo 2018.Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (MD2) is a multisystem disease, predominantly affecting the proximal limb muscles, eyes, endocrine organs, heart and intestines. Longterm asymptomatic creatine kinase (hyper-CKemia) of more than 20 years duration, in association with hyperlipidemia and diabetes, as a manifestation of MD2 has not been reported. A 52-year-old female with a history of hyper-CKemia since the age of 32 years associated with diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hyperuricemia, developed anginal chest pain and proximal muscle weakness together with clinical myotonia when opening the fists at age 51 years. Examination revealed a left anterior hemiblock, sensorimotor neuropathy, extensive myotonic discharges on needle electromyography (EMG) and a CCTG-expansion of 134 bp on the ZNF9 gene. The family history was positive for hyper-CKemia and muscle weakness. In addition, over the previous years, she had developed vesico-ureteral reflux, cutaneous melanoma, renal cysts, cervix dysplasias, thrombocytosis, cataracts, arterial hypertension, heterozygous Factor V Leiden mutation, cholecystolithiasis, multiple ovarial cysts and vitamin D deficiency. Asymptomatic, long-term hyper-CKemia in association with multisystem disease should raise the suspicion of a MD2. Rare manifestations of MD2 may be thrombocytosis, hyperuricemia, vesico-ureteral reflux, gallstones, hypertension and cyst formation. In patients with asymptomatic hyper-CKemia, needle EMG should be considered. Myotonic dystrophy type 2 may take a mild course over many years if the CCTG-expansion is short.","['Veterinarmedizinische Universitat Wien', 'Human Genetic Laboratory', 'Rudolfstifung Hospital']",['Austria'],"['Finsterer J.', 'Stollberger C.', 'Gencik M.', 'Reining-Festa A.', 'Loewe-Grgurin M.']","['Cardiac involvement', 'Creatine kinase (hyper-CKemia)', 'Multisystem disease', 'Myotonia', 'Neuromuscular', 'ZNF9 gene']",Balkan Journal of Medical Genetics,Sciendo,"['Genetics', 'Genetics (clinical)']","['BIOC', 'MEDI']",Article,1,10.0,2018
A novel mutation in a newborn baby leading to glycogen storage disease type Ia,"© 2018 Dorum S, Gorukmez O, published by Sciendo 2018.Glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD1A) is caused by mutations in the G6PC gene. The G6PC gene was first cloned in 1993. Since then, many different mutations have been identified leading to this disease. Hepatomegaly is one of the important clinical manifestations of the disease. A 23-day-old girl was admitted to the hospital due to respiratory distress. Her physical examination was normal except for tachypnea. She had hypoglycemia, lactic academia, hyperlipidemia and hyperuricemia. With these clinical findings, GSD1A was considered in the patient and the diagnosis was genetically confirmed. By direct sequencing of the G6PC gene, we identified a novel homozygous variation (c.137T>G/p.Leu46Arg) in the patient and the healthy mother and father were heterozygotes for the variant.

Epigenetic signature of chronic maternal stress load during pregnancy might be a potential biomarker for spontaneous preterm birth,"© 2018 Rogac M, Peterlin B published by Sciendo.Preterm birth is the leading cause of mortality in newborn infants and can lead to significant neonatal morbidities. Spontaneous preterm birth accounts for at least 50.0% of all preterm births. We argue that chronic maternal stress load, which is an important risk factor for spontaneous preterm birth, could be represented by epigenetic signature of several specific genetic loci in the mother's blood. A literature search was done in PubMed with the following keywords: ""DNA methylation,"" ""epigenetics,"" ""maternal stress"" and ""preterm birth"" from year 2000 to 2017. We suggest that these genetic loci might be related to vulnerability and hypersensibility of stress response during pregnancy in women with preterm births. The mother's epi-genetic stress bioprofile was supposed to be a result of chronic maternal stress load since her birth. This epigenetic bioprofile might also be a potential biomarker for spontaneous preterm birth. DNA methylation changes are tissue-specific and human stress response manifests mostly through the central nervous system (CNS). Nevertheless, we found evidence that methylation changes of DNA isolated from blood leucocytes might be a reliable measure of stress-related epigenetic changes that occur in the CNS. Evaluating biological mechanisms through the development of simple assays based on epigenetic changes to measure chronic stress loads in expectant mothers can lead to our ability to prepare more effective measures for the prevention of preterm births, as well as leading to more effective treatment strategies for both expectant mothers and their newborns.",['Univerzitetni Klinični Center Ljubljana'],['Slovenia'],"['Peterlin B.', 'Rogac M.']","['Epigenetics', 'Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis', 'Maternal stress', 'Preterm birth']",Balkan Journal of Medical Genetics,Sciendo,"['Genetics', 'Genetics (clinical)']","['BIOC', 'MEDI']",Article,7,50.0,2018
Characteristic diagnostic clues of metatropic dysplasia: The lumbothoracic humpback with dumbbell appearance of the long bones,"© 2018 Gucev Z, Kalcev G, Laban N, Bozinovski Z, Popovski N, Saveski A, Daskalov B, Plaseska-Karanfilska D, Tasic V, published by Sciendo.Metatropic dysplasia (MD) is a rare skeletal dysplasia associated with heterozygous mutations in the TRPV4 gene. We describe a 28-month-old boy with knock-knees referred for metabolic investigation suspected of carrying vitamin D-resistant rickets. He has received regular vitamin D prophylaxis at the usual dose. Laboratory investigations revealed normal values for calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase. He was short (-3.5 SDS), his mental development was normal, and he started to walk at the age of 22 months. The diagnostic clue for the diagnosis of metatropic dysplasia was the presence of the hump back in the upper lumbar and lower thoracic vertebrae, in addition to a long and narrow chest. An X-ray survey of the skeleton revealed platyspondyly, dysplastic metaphyses with dumbbell appearance of the long bones, kyphoscoliosis, and narrow and elongated thorax with short ribs. This is the first patient with MD in the Republic of Macedonia. Knock-knees were the cause of his referral, as a peculiarity of his phenotype. The very presence of the hump back, and the dumbbell appearance of the long bones distinguished the MD from other bone dysplasias with similar characteristics. We believe that the presence of those two features can shorten the path to accurate diagnosis in the crowded field of overlapping skeletal dysplasias. The diagnosis of MD in this patient was further confirmed by the discovery of the mutation c.2396C>T; p.Pro799Leu (P799L) of the TRPV4 gene.","['General Private Hospital-Remedika', 'SS Cyril and Methodius University Faculty of Medicine', ""Clinic for Children's Diseases Skopje"", 'Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts']",['North Macedonia'],"['Gucev Z.', 'Popovski N.', 'Tasic V.', 'Kalcev G.', 'Plaseska-Karanfilska D.', 'Bozinovski Z.', 'Daskalov B.', 'Saveski A.', 'Laban N.']","['A dumbbell appearance', 'Kyphosis', 'Metatropic dysplasia', 'TRPV4 gene mutation']",Balkan Journal of Medical Genetics,Sciendo,"['Genetics', 'Genetics (clinical)']","['BIOC', 'MEDI']",Article,1,7.0,2018

The techniques based on the latest trends in molecular biology may have application in diagnosis of metastatic TC. The aim of this study was to apply and analyze mRNA expression in peripheral blood of thyrotropin receptor [thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR-mRNA)] gene and thyroglobulin (Tg-mRNA) gene using 2-ΔΔCt method in differentiated TC patients and healthy individuals. Fifty-seven subjects were included in the study, consisting of 40 patients with TC and 17 healthy volunteers as a control group. Total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood and used for two-step reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Real-time PCR was performed with appropriate primers. Relative quantification using the 2-ΔΔCt method was applied. Thyroid carcinoma patients with metastatic disease or loco-regional relapse expressed TSHR-mRNA by a 8.57-fold higher level than healthy controls. Thyroid carcinoma patients with biochemical relapse expressed TSHR-mRNA by a 14.17-fold higher level than healthy controls, while expression of Tg-mRNA was 6.6-fold higher in TC patients with metastatic disease and loco-regional relapse than healthy controls and 8.34-fold higher level compared with TC patients with excellent response to treatment.

The frequency of EGFR and KRAS mutations in the Turkish population with non-small cell lung cancer and their response to erlotinib therapy,"© 2018 Demiray A, Yaren A, Karagenç N, Bir F, Demiray AG, Karagür ER, Tokgün O, Elmas L, Akça H, published by Sciendo.In this study, profiles of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Kirsten ras sarcoma (KRAS) mutations and response to erlotinib therapy have been investigated in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). DNA from 300 patients with NSCLC was extracted from paraf-fin-embedded tissues. After the extracted DNA was sequenced by pyrosequencing method, a total of 97 (32.0%) patients out of 300 were detected to carry an EGFR mutation and 75 (25.0%) patients out of 300 carried a KRAS mutation; 20 (6.6%) patients were detected to carry both of EGFR and KRAS mutations. The EGFR mutations were found to be statistically significant in female patients (48.0 women vs. 28.0% men, non smokers (49.0 vs. 26.0%) and adenocarcinoma (37.8 vs. squamous 26.8%). The overall rate of survival in patients receiving erlotinib therapy than in patients who did not. In patients without the KRAS mutation, the median overall survival rate was 161 ± 30 weeks with erlotinib therapy and 90 ± 13 weeks in patients without erlotinib therapy. In patients having KRAS mutation, the median overall survival was 98 ± 16 weeks with erlotinib therapy and 34 ± 16 weeks with no erlotinib therapy.

Next generation sequencing identified a novel multi exon deletion of the NF1 gene in a Chinese pedigree with neurofibromatosis type 1,"© 2018 Yang J, An J-X, Liu X-L, Wang Z-Q, Xie G-M, Yang X-L, Xu S-J, Feng F, Ni Y, published by Sciendo 2018.Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disease involving neurocutaneous abnormalities. Neurofibromatosis type 1 is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the neurofibromas and café-au-lait spots. Mutation in the NF 1 gene causes NF1. The NF 1 gene encodes neurofibromin. In this study, we found a 31-year-old Chinese boy with NF1. He presented only with café-au-lait spots over the whole body. The proband's mother had a severe phenotype with neurofibroma and café-au-lait macules over her whole body, mostly in the facial region. A novel multi exon deletion c.(4661+1-4662-1)-(5748+1-5749-1)del; [EX36-39DEL] on the NF 1 gene has been identified in the proband. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) confirmed that this mutation is co-segregated well and was inherited from the proband's mother. The mutation was absent in the proband's father and normal individuals. The novel multi exon deletion results in the formation of a truncated NF1 protein that caused the NF1 phenotype in this family. Our present study also emphasized the significance of rapid, accurate and cost-effective screening for the patient with NF1 by next generation sequencing (NGS).","[""Third People's Hospital of Liangzhou District"", 'Gansu Provincial Maternity and Child-care Hospital']",['China'],"['Xu S-J.', 'Ni Y.', 'An J-X.', 'Xie G-M.', 'Liu X-L.', 'Wang Z-Q.', 'Yang X-L.', 'Feng F.', 'Yang J.']","['Café-au-lai-spots', 'Multi-exon deletion', 'Neurofibromas', 'Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)', 'Next generation sequencing (NGS)', 'Novel mutation']",Balkan Journal of Medical Genetics,Sciendo,"['Genetics', 'Genetics (clinical)']","['BIOC', 'MEDI']",Article,2,6.0,2018

Effects of cold winters and roost site stability on population development of non-native Asian ring-necked parakeets (Alexandrinus manillensis) in temperate Central Europe-results of a 16-year census,"© 2019 Michael P. Braun, et al., published by Sciendo.Asian ring-necked parakeets (Alexandrinus manillensis, formerly Psittacula krameri, hereafter RNP) first bred in Germany in 1969. Since then, RNP numbers increased in all three major German subpopulations (Rhineland, Rhine-Main, Rhine-Neckar) over the period 2003-2018. In the Rhine-Neckar region, the population increased to more than fivefold within only 15 years. Interestingly, there was no significant breeding range expansion of RNP in the period 2010-2018. In 2018, the total number of RNP in Germany amounted to >16,200 birds. Differences in RNP censuses between years were evident. Surprisingly, cold winters (extreme value,-13.7 °C) and cold weather conditions in the breeding season (coldest month average,-1.36 °C) were not able to explain between-year variation. This finding suggests that in general winter mortality is low-with exceptions for winters 2008/2009 and 2009/2010, and a population-relevant loss of broods is low in our study population. Surprisingly, the social behaviour in terms of spatio-temporal stability of roost sites could well explain positive and negative population trends. Years of spatially stable and regularly used roost sites seem to correlate with increasing population sizes. In contrast, known shifts of RNP among different roost sites or the formations of new roost sites by split are related to population stagnation or a decrease in numbers. Climate change may lead to further range expansion as cities not suitable yet for RNP may become so in the near future.""","['Zoologisches Forschungsmuseum Alexander Koenig', 'NABU Köln', 'Zoo Heidelberg', 'AG Zoologischer Garten Köln', 'Universität Heidelberg']",['Germany'],"['Kemper A.', 'Laucht S.', 'Sauer-Gurth H.', 'Bruslund N.', 'Parau L.G.', 'Bauer A.', 'Reinke-Beck M.I.', 'Gross B.', 'Koch E.', 'Braun N.', 'Krause T.', 'Kragten S.', 'Schidelko K.', 'Kremer P.', 'Braun M.P.', 'Wink M.', 'Hubatsch M.', 'Braun M.S.', 'Romero J.', 'Stiels D.', 'Franz D.', 'Dreyer W.', 'Walter C.', 'Nekum S.', 'Bruslund S.']","['birds', 'climate change', 'Invasive alien species', 'population trends', 'weather conditions']",European Journal of Ecology,Sciendo,"['Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics', 'Ecology']","['AGRI', 'ENVI']",Article,1,28.0,2019
Habitat suitability analysis for mountain lions (Puma concolor) recolonization/reintroduction in Minnesota,"© 2019 Mbongowo J Mbuh, Neil Vruno, published by Sciendo.The mountain lion range once extended throughout the state of Minnesota. The breeding population has been greatly reduced with time, new roads, and timber harvesting, which have broken large tracts of contiguous forest into isolated patches that are too small and no longer suitable for the breeding mountain lion population. The objective of this study is to use suitability analysis to determine the most suitable habitat to conserve mountain lion populations threatened by habitat fragmentation. To attain our objective, we created three sub models that contribute to the overarching goal of the suitability model. A habitat sub model was developed for finding the best habitat, a food sub model for access to the maximum amount of food needed, and a security sub model focusing on the distance from houses, roads, and urban development. Using the Weighted Sum tool, the three sub models were combined to produce a suitability surface based on the trade-off of the preferences of the goals represented by each sub model. Our suitability model shows large areas of high-quality mountain lion habitat in the northern and north-eastern sections of the state. These areas contain favourable locations for mountain lion habitat, such as forested land cover, low-density populations, steep slopes, short distances to streams, and area unimpeded by major roads. The southern and western parts of the state are characterized by lower slopes, more agricultural land, grassland, developed land, and higher population density, which results in lower quality habitat. The twin cities have the worst mountain lion habitat.",['University of North Dakota'],['United States'],"['Vruno N.', 'Mbuh M.J.']","['food model', 'habitat model', 'model builder', 'mountain lion', 'security model', 'Suitability analysis']",European Journal of Ecology,Sciendo,"['Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics', 'Ecology']","['AGRI', 'ENVI']",Article,2,137.0,2019

As a result of the research, it was determined that the works included in the sample, which were notated as fa # decision pitched, brought up twenty different types of pitch arrangement in the light of their updated notations and that these types of sequences were mostly associated with intricate curtain arrangements. In the light of the obtained data, a taxonomized repertoire bundle was presented on the basis of the curtain arrangement that the teachers who teach folk / work oriented Misket tune system can use in their lessons.","['Iskenderun Technical University', 'Necmettin Erbakan Üniversitesi']",['Turkey'],"['Ozdek A.', 'Gerekten S.E.']","['baglama', 'Misket folk songs', 'Misket tuning system', 'pitch', 'pitch arrangement']",Online Journal of Music Sciences,Nilgun SAZAK,['Music'],['ARTS'],Article,0,6.0,2020
"The Influence of Perch Height Selection on Vocalization of Pied Triller, Lalage nigra (Aves: Campephagidae) in Suburban Landscapes, Sarawak","© 2020, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak. All rights reserved.Understanding how birds utilised songs and calls to communicate among conspecifics is crucial for their survival, yet it remains an understudied area in bird ecology. We studied the influence of perch height selection on the vocalisation of Pied Triller, a common garden bird, in two suburban landscapes namely Pustaka Negeri Sarawak Recreational Park, Kuching and Universiti Malaysia Sarawak campus, Kota Samarahan from October 2018 to February 2019. Using a Marantz recorder connected to a parabolic reflector, we recorded calls and songs during morning (0630-1030 hr) and late afternoon (1600-1830 hr). Perch object, tree species, roost substrate and perch height from the ground were identified and measured. Clear and good quality spectrograms were used directly to describe song and call types. Photos and video recordings were analysed to describe perch behaviour. The vocal output representatives were then matched to the corresponding behaviour displayed. Our results revealed that Pied Trillers emit four different vocal outputs namely (i) song type, (ii) call type A, (iii) call type B and (iv) call type C. A total of nine behaviours were observed, of which the perch-hop behaviour was observed the most from both male and female Pied Trillers (33.71%), followed by perching (29.21%), foraging (20.22%), preening (7.78%), defecating (2.25%), eating (2.25%), roosting (2.25%), bill wipe (1.12%) and flight (1.12%). They prefer to roost on high perch to emit calls compared to songs. This probably suggest that Pied Triller prioritised vocal transmission and signalling to avoid being masked by surrounding anthropogenic noises and to avoid being conspicuous to potential predators. The most frequently visited perch object was the Weeping fig tree, Ficus benjamina.","['Universiti Putra Malaysia', 'Universiti Malaysia Sarawak']",['Malaysia'],"['Muhammad Adam Mah A.N.M.', 'Ramji M.F.S.']","['Call', 'perch height', 'Pied Triller', 'song', 'suburban landscapes']",Borneo Journal of Resource Science and Technology,Universiti Malaysia Sarawak,"['Biochemistry', 'Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics', 'Water Science and Technology', 'Animal Science and Zoology', 'Biotechnology', 'Forestry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Ecology']","['AGRI', 'BIOC', 'ENVI']",Article,0,27.0,2020
"Diversity of Airborne Fungi at Pepper Plantation Lembah Bidong, Kuala Terengganu","© 2020, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak. All rights reserved.Piper nigrum L. is well-known as the king of spices and widely used in various field such as food and medicines. In Malaysia, 98% of pepper production comes from the state of Sarawak. The National Commodity Policy (2011-2020) targets to increase the pepper plantation area from the current 16,331 ha to 20,110 ha by year 2020. However, pepper diseases remain as a major challenge in the pepper industry. A great number of airborne fungi pathogen may contribute to a significant economic loss in pepper production. Therefore, this study aims to morphologically identify the diversity of fungi obtained from air-borne samples in a pepper planation that are capable of causing pepper plant diseases. This experiment was conducted at a pepper plantation near Lembah Bidong, Kuala Terengganu. An Andersen spore sampler was used to collect the fungi spores. Culture based identification were then made. The study resulted in the identification of four genus of fungi such as Fusarium sp, Fusarium semictectum Fusarium oxysporum, Curvularia sp., Penicillium sp. and Trichoderma sp. (Ascomycetes).

"Is Pulmonary Thromboembolism uncommon in Nigeria? A case series in a private tertiary hospital in Ogun State, Nigeria","© BUMJ. 2020.Background: Pulmonary thromboembolism is total or partial obstruction of one or more divisions of pulmonary arterial vasculature. It is a common disease presentation that is well studied and documented in the United States of America and Western Europe. It is often the result of part of a thrombotic lesion in deep veins (Deep Vein Thrombosis) elsewhere in the body most commonly the lower limbs and the pelvic region. There are few documented cases in Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa as a result of poorly equipped hospitals and poorly trained health care personnel. Case presentation: Twenty-Nine (29) cases were seen in a Private Tertiary institution in Ogun State, Nigeria. Computerized Tomography with Pulmonary Angiography had helped to confirm these cases, with prompt intervention thereby reducing morbidity and mortality significantly. Only 3(three) mortality was recorded out of 29 cases seen between July 2016 and June 2020. Discussion and conclusion: Pulmonary thromboembolism is not uncommon in Nigerians and black Africans as available data previously suggested.

Management of calcaneal fractures: a case series,"© BUMJ.Background Untreated or inappropriately treated, calcaneal fractures can result in arthritis, chronic ankle pain, and ankle deformity which can significantly impact the lifestyle of affected patients. Even though calcaneal fractures are common among those with multiple injuries, they can easily be missed, and not treating them would significantly impact on the patient negatively. It is therefore important a high index of suspicion is made for this injury among patients involved in high-energy trauma. Case Presentation This article is a retrospective recall of the six patients seen with calcaneal fractures that were treated in our hospital between 2010 and 2018, they were mainly multiply injured and the advanced trauma life support (ATLS) protocol helped to delineate these fractures, the use of modern-day operative and non-operative methods of management and rehabilitation were employed. Discussion and conclusion Calcaneal fractures are mostly associated with high-energy trauma which includes falls from heights or vehicle accidents with almost 50% soft tissue involvement. This is similar to cases presented in this paper as all the patients were either involved in road traffic accidents or had fallen from a height, however, soft tissue destruction manifesting as open fractures were absent in our series. Calcaneal fractures are rare and can easily be missed as patients may present as multiply injured.

The effects of togu-jumper use on core muscle activity during plank exercise,"© Korea Institute of Sport Science.[Purpose] This study was to analyze and compare series of muscle activities during plank exercises with use of togu-jumper. [Methods] Ten male subjects (age 26.9±1.7 yrs, height 172.2±5.7 cm, weight 66.5±7.5 kg) who have no musculoskeletal disorder with one's upper or lower limb were selected as subjects. To analyze and compare series of muscle activity, five of surface EMG electrodes were attached to the upper rectus abdominis (URA), lower rectus abdominis (LRA), external abdominal oblique (EO), erector spinae (ES) and gluteus maximus (GM). Each subject did plank exercise on stable support surfaces (normal surfaces) and unstable support surfaces with the togu-jumper. For each dependent variable, one-way ANOVA with repeated measures were performed with significance level p<.05. Contrasts were performed to execute post tests for results with statistical significance. [Results] The study showed that the average IEMG values of URA and LRA increased in Upper (Togu-jumper used upper limb) compared to normal surfaces. This is perhaps because the effects of URA more than any other muscles for body stability. Furthermore, the peak IEMG values of LRA increased in Upper and Lower (Togu-jumper used lower limb) compared to normal surfaces. In addition, peak IEMG values of EO increased in Upper compared to Normal. This may have resulted due to momentary strong muscle activity in LRA and EO to correct body posture and balance. Therefore, using Togu-jumper on upper limb maximizes the performance of core training in plank exercise. [Conclusions] The study may be further applied to a method for effective training. It is considered that research and analysis has to be further done on modified plank exercise. Additionally, it is necessary to analyze not only global muscle but also local muscle, as a comprehensive research, to suggest ideal method for plank exercise.",['Kyungpook National University'],['South Korea'],"['Moon H.-S.', 'Jung J.-H.', 'Chae W.-S.']","['core muscle', 'plank exercise', 'togu-jumper']",Korean Journal of Sport Science,Korea Institute of Sport Science,"['Orthopedics and Sports Medicine', 'Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health']","['MEDI', 'HEAL']",Article,0,18.0,2019
"Knowledge, attitude, and utilization of HIV counseling and testing by female sex workers in Lagos State, Nigeria","© BUMJ.Objectives: The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) epidemic continues to expand among female sex workers (FSWs) who have limited access to and utilization of HIV counseling and testing services (HCT). HCT plays a pivotal role in increasing knowledge and awareness to prevent, treat, and control HIV/AIDS. The study objective was to determine the knowledge, attitude, utilization of HCT among brothel-based FSWs (BBFSWs). Method: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study among 300 BBFSWs in Lagos State. The respondents were recruited by snowballing after a multistage sampling method was used in the selection of the brothels. The data was collected using an adapted interviewer-administered questionnaire and analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 23. The level of statistical significance was set at p<0.05. Results: Majority (63.0%) of the respondents were between the ages of 21-30 years and 67.4% had good knowledge of HIV and HCT. About 75.0% had a positive attitude towards HCT and 55.6% of FSWs in this study had utilized an HCT center in the past. The main reason for not taking HIV test was the fear of a positive result (90.6%) while the main reasons given for not visiting any HCT center were lack of confidentiality (13.3%), stigmatization (14.8%), and distance to the HCT center (67.2%). Conclusion: There was a good knowledge of HCT and a positive attitude towards HCT services by the respondents. The main reasons for not taking the HIV test as indicated by respondents were fear of a positive result.

HIV Non-Occupational Post-Exposure Prophylaxis Awareness Among Undergraduate Students of a Private University in South-West Nigeria,"© BUMJ.Objectives: The Human Immunodeficiency virus causes an infection of public health importance with about 71% of the global burden in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Nigeria, 3.2 million people are living with HIV, and 838,000-1.3 million of the cases are found among youths. Although Non-Occupational Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP) is a safe and efficacious method of HIV prevention, it remains an underutilized prevention strategy in Nigeria. This study aimed to determine the awareness level of nPEP after sexual and other non-occupational exposure to HIV among undergraduate students of a private University. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted among 395 undergraduates’ students. Data was collected by pre-tested structured self-administered questionnaires. Data obtained from the study were analyzed using the IBM SPSS Statistics version 20 software program and Frequency distribution tables with percentages and cross-tables were used for data description. Results: About 42.8% were aware of nPEP. Most of the respondents 361 (91.4%) knew that PEP is to be given after HIV exposure risk following sexual intercourse. Although 79.5% of the respondents indicated that they will see their physician after unprotected sexual intercourse and other non-occupational exposure to HIV, the majority neither knows about nPEP initiation time, 247 (62.5%) nor its duration, 286 (72.4%). Conclusions: A low level of awareness was observed among our study participants, therefore, consistent health education and promotion of nPEP will improve its awareness, uptake, and possibly reduce the prevalence of HIV among our youths.",['Babcock University'],['Nigeria'],"['Paul A.O.', 'Enyi B.I.', 'Faluyi B.', 'Elikwu C.J.', 'Omeonu A.C.', 'Obaya F.D.', 'Tayo B.', 'Shonekan O.A.', 'Takon E.P.', 'Okangba C.C.', 'Nwamannah F.O.', 'Ajani T.A.', 'Nwadike V.U.', 'Coker A.O.']","['HIV', 'Nigeria', 'Non-Occupational Exposure', 'Post-exposure prophylaxis', 'Sexual intercourse', 'Undergraduates']",Babcock University Medical Journal,Babcock Medical Society,['Medicine (all)'],['MEDI'],Article,0,31.0,2020
A historical significance of first integration of the Korean Sports & Olympic Committee,"© Korea Institute of Sport Science.[Purpose] This study is to examine the historical facts about the integration of the Korean Sports Association, the Korean Olympic Committee, and the Korean School Sports Association in 1968. [Methods] Primary and secondary data were used to understand the integration process of the three organizations. [Result] First, immediately after liberation, the Korean Sports Association was reorganized and a number of new sports organizations were founded. Second, in the 1960s, the military regime exerted the government's control, making all social groups essential to register in accordance with the Act on Social Group Registration. Third, the Korea Olympic Committee and the Korean School Sports Association frequently caused friction as they operated overlapping projects with the existing Korean Sports Association. Fourth, in February 1968, the government consolidated three groups that were considered social issues based on the experience of dissolving the Korean Special Sports Association. Fifth, the integration of the three organizations is significant in that it prevented redundant projects and wasted budget, and resolved the discord in the sports world. [Conclusion] The first integration of the Korean Sports Association in 1968 was a historical event that absorbed the Korean Olympic Committee and the Korean School Sports Association. The integration of the three organizations is viewed as a solution for the systematic operation of the sports administration, but on the one hand, it has become the top-ranking organization in the Korean sports community since this time by well blocking the checks of the Korean Olympic Committee and Korean School Sports Association.

USING SOCIAL STRATEGIES IN TEACHING GERMAN AS A FOREIGN LANGUAGE AT PRIMARY SCHOOL LEVEL,"© 2020, Faculty of Philology Banja Luka. All rights reserved.The major purpose of this quantitative research is to investigate the frequency of social learning strategies used in teaching German as a foreign language within the population of primary school students of the higher grade (corresponding to the age of 11 to 14). Furthermore, the aim of this study is to explore the statistically significant differences between pupil’s gender, age, second language performance assessment as predictors and social learning strategies as dependent variables. The research was done during the first semester of the school year 2019 / 2020 with 218 students. The modified questionnaire Strategy Inventory for Language Learning designed by Rebecca Oxford, Likert and Guttman scale were used for data collection. The Cronbach’s Alpha reliability coefficient of the modified scale was a = .89. The research data was analysed by a quantitative method with IBM SPSS 23 and the results revealed that the primary school learners employed social learning strategies with an average value of 3.30, which represents a medium frequency of use. Results have shown that female students tend to use social learning strategies more frequently than males (Mf = 11.05; Mm = 9.74) and their usage becomes less intense with age (М5 = 4.14, М6 = 3.69, М7 = 2.42, М8 = 2.39). Performance assessment is not contributing significantly to their frequency (rho = .18, p = .39). The Mann - Whitney U test is used to compare whether there is a statistically significant difference in the dependent variable for two independent groups: Students in late childhood and students in early adolescence. Results have shown that the second group of students use rarer social learning strategies than the first. Therefore, older learners were exposed to the strategies input. The Wilcoxon signed - rank test was used to compare repeated measurements on a single sample to assess whether their population mean ranks differ. Results have shown that strategies input contributing statistically significant to the detected changes in a date caused by strategies input (z = - 5.24 , p = .01). The slight difference between arithmetic means (М1 = 3.22; М2 = 3.36) was explained with the Affective filter hypothesis Stephen Krashen developed in the 1980s.

All rights reserved.Context: Rabies remains a public health challenge in many parts of the world with over 90% of human rabies cases worldwide attributed to dog bites. In India the annual incidence of dog bite is 1.9%. The study was conducted to analyse the distribution of dog bite cases as per time, place and person. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was conducted between Jan-2016 and Dec- 2017. A total of 228 victims of dog bite were interviewed. They were selected using systematic random sampling technique. Data was analysed using SPSS. Spot maps were prepared. Results: The proportion of adults being bitten by dog was more than that of children. Most of the bites occurred after evening hours. There was similarity in the place of residence and place of occurrence of bite in 81% of the cases. A statistically significant association was seen between the type of occupation and place of occurrence of dog bite. Conclusion: Epidemiological mapping of dog bite cases gives more insight to understand the problem and aids in planning control measures against occurrence dog bite. Most dog bites occurred at hours when the man dog interaction was highest.

Detailed history, clinical examination and necessary investigations were reviewed. Results: Among 308 patients, 302(98.05%) presented with physiological skin changes of pregnancy, 118(38.31%) had pregnancy specific and 185(60.06%) had pregnancy non-specific dermatoses. The most common physiological change was pigmentary changes (n=294). Atopic eruption of pregnancy (n=79) was the most common pregnancy specific dermatoses followed by polymorphic eruption of pregnancy (n=38). In non-specific dermatoses, infectious diseases were more common (fungal, n=128; viral, n=25). Conclusion: Pregnancy non-specific dermatoses were seen more commonly than pregnancy specific dermatoses. Lower socioeconomic strata and overcrowding may be the reasons behind large number of infectious dermatoses that we saw in our study.",['Smt SCL General Hospital'],['India'],"['Neazee S.T.', 'Rathod S.P.', 'Agarwal P.', 'Jagati A.', 'Chaudhari S.V.']","['Atopic eruption of pregnancy', 'Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy', 'Pregnancy', 'pregnancy non-specific dermatoses']",National Journal of Community Medicine,MedSci Publications,"['Medicine (miscellaneous)', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Epidemiology']",['MEDI'],Article,0,13.0,2020
VISUAL SOURCES OF OLD RUSSIA IN HISTORICAL RESEARCH: SOME METHODOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS,"© 2020, National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics. All rights reserved.The article considers the problem of the methodological difficulties of the work of historians with visual sources of Old Russia. Its relevance is determined by the paradoxical epistemological situation that has developed in historical science as a result of a visual turn. Historians who are researching Old Russia and constantly experiencing a shortage of sources could significantly expand the source base at their disposal, but they traditionally do not appreciate the information potential of ancient Russian art. The article analyzes methodological ideas related to the problems of “decryption” and interpretation of information from Russian and European medieval visual sources contained in the works of structuralism (Lotman, Uspensky), specialists in the field of iconography and iconology (Panofsky, Gombrich), symbolic history (M. Pasturo), source study methodologist Lappo-Danilevsky. The species and historical features of this type of sources create serious difficulties for historians, require the development of a methodology for working with “unrealistic” images, but also open up prospects for a meaningful enrichment of research. Russian and foreign science has accumulated sufficient theoretical and practical experience in this area. Therefore it is hoped that research on the visual sources of Old Russia will expand and take its rightful place in the corpus of historical knowledge.",['Program Systems Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences'],['Russian Federation'],['Sukina L.'],"['Ancient Russian Art', 'History of Old Russia', 'Informational Potential', 'Interpretation Methods', 'Source Study Methodology', 'Types and Classes of Sources', 'Visual Source']",Filosofiya.

Menopause Related Health Problems and Quality of Life of Menopausal Women from Urban Slums of Western Maharashtra: An Observational Study,"© 2020, MedSci Publications. All rights reserved.Introduction: During menopause, women may experience vasomotor, psychosocial, physical, as well as sexual dysfunction. Studies on menopausal issues and health demand priority in the Indian scenario due to the growing population of menopausal women as a result of their increased life expectancy. Materials& Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a predesigned, structured questionnaire based on socio-demographic variables and menopausal symptoms as per the MEN-QOL questionnaire and administered by the investigator. Postmenopausal women coming to UHTC were selected purpos-ively until the sample size was reached and interviewed. Data collected were coded and entered in an Excel sheet. Values were expressed in the form of frequency and percentages. Results: The mean age at menopause was 48.8 years. Most frequent menopausal symptoms were aching in muscle and joints (72.9%), feeling tired (65%), poor memory (61.4%), lower backache (49%), and difficulty in sleeping (54.3%). The vasomotor and sexual domains complained when compared to physical and psychological domains. Conclusion: The age at onset of menopause in an urban area of southwestern Maharashtra is 48.8 years which is four years more than the mean menopause age for Indian women. The most frequent menopausal symptoms were aching in muscle and joints, feeling tired and poor memory.",['V.M.G.M.C.'],['India'],"['Kotnis S.D.', 'Anandkumar V.']","['Menopausal symptoms', 'Quality of life']",National Journal of Community Medicine,MedSci Publications,"['Medicine (miscellaneous)', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Epidemiology']",['MEDI'],Article,0,19.0,2020

Architectural interventions to mitigate occupational stress among office workers,"© 2020, Architectural Research Centers Consortium. All rights reserved.Stress is one issue that affects the health and well-being of every building occupant. The negative effects of stress are more pronounced in workplaces, where stress can act as a major agent of disease and an impediment to em-ployee productivity and satisfaction. The underlying causes of occupational stress are varied and include job insecu-rity, extended hours, excessive workload, altercations within the organization, tight deadlines, changes in responsi-bilities, and lack of autonomy, among others. One of the factors that can contribute to overall occupational stress is the working environment itself—a factor that can be mitigated by design. While occupational stress may arise from a multiplicity of causes, designers have numerous interventions they can employ to decrease it. The literature on occupational health, well-being, satisfaction, and productivity is broad and multifaceted; however, this paper is limited to exploring stress factors that correlate with the built environment and focuses on employees who are experiencing a high rate of stress in office buildings as the target group. To address these issues, supporting literature was explored to identify environmental interventions that could reduce stress or enhance the stress-cop-ing abilities of workers in offices by improving the environmental quality of the built environment. This article explores the following questions: How does space cause people to experience mental stress? In what ways can the built environment itself be a generator of stress? What are the main environmental factors in offices that can mitigate the stress levels of employees or help them to recover more easily from work-related stress? To answer these questions, it is necessary to understand the causes and mechanisms of chronic stress, including work-related stressors, and to identify the factors in the built environment that can be associated with occupational stress. The present paper is based on concurrent analyses of supporting literature in the rather different fields of architec-ture, public health, psychology, management, and environmental studies. The outcome is an identified set of prac-tical strategies that provide solutions for healthier and more productive workplaces. By concentrating on measures that can reduce employee stress levels, these strategies can be used as a source for evidence-based workplace de-signs.",,,['Norouzianpour H.'],"['Biophilic design', 'COVID-19', 'Evidence-based design', 'Occupational stress', 'Office building']",Enquiry,Architectural Research Centers Consortium,"['Architecture', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'History']","['ARTS', 'ENGI']",Article,0,78.0,2020
Modelling as a Method of Analytical History: Its Use in the Study of Human Capital Formation,"© 2020, National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics. All rights reserved.The article focuses on the qualitative method of schematization. Schemes are commonly used in teaching to illustrate the theoretical material but, as the article shows, they can also serve as an effective research tool since they are verbally concise, visually accessible and systemically organized. Schemes help researchers highlight the aspects that are crucial for understanding the nature of a given phenomenon and reveal the key structural, functional and causal relationships. The potential of schematization as a research method is illustrated by the authors’ own experience of modelling the structure and processes of human capital formation in an industrial city. Modelling brings to light the specific characteristics of diferent stages in the transition from traditional to industrial and post-industrial society. Modelling is based on the assumption that each historical period has its own socio-demographic profle, which can be summarized in the notion of human potential. Each period is characterized by specific scenarios of human potential being transformed into human capital or quasi-capital. Our study uses models in the form of fowcharts supplied with descriptions. The models help us conceptualize the historical analysis of human capital formation in an industrial city during modernization. They prove to be particularly useful for addressing the tasks that constitute the frst stage of a historical study.",['Uralʹskiĭ Federalʹnyĭ Universitet'],['Russian Federation'],['Mazur L.'],"['Historical Model', 'Human Capital', 'Human Potential', 'Modelling', 'Quasi-Capital', 'Scheme', 'Types of Models', 'Types of Schemes']",Filosofiya.

Contact Tracing Assessment of COVID 19 Transmissions In Bhopal District,"© 2020, MedSci Publications. All rights reserved.Introduction: Contact tracing is a central public health response to infectious disease outbreaks, especially in the early stages of an outbreak when specific treatments are limited. Current clinical and epidemiological data are insufficient to understand the full extent of the transmission potential of the COVID pandemic. The main advantages are that it can identify potentially infected individuals before severe symptoms emerge, and if conducted sufficiently quickly can prevent onward transmission from the secondary cases. Hence the study was undertaken. Methodology: It was a cross-sectional study conducted by the Department of Community Medicine, Bhopal from 9th May to 30th June 2020. Results: Out of 426 COVID positive patients, 54.93% were asymptomatic and 45.07% symptomatic. Fever was the most common presentation reported by the COVID positive patients. Mean incubation period was 4.68 ±2.63 days. Contact with COVID-19 positive cases was major source of infection identified. Only 9.86% patients had co-morbidity. Out of 10512 contacts traced, 66.65% i.e., 6902 samples were collected. Overall Positivity rate was found to be 4.30%. The positivity of the advanced contact tracing is 2.42%.

In the essay, a thematic reading of the materials relating to the literary subject was actualised, which led to the development of an equally comparative-formal and theoretical-literary discourse.

Language policy of the russian federation,"© 2020, Faculty of Philology Banja Luka. All rights reserved.This paper presents a sociolinguistic analysis of the current linguistic situation in the Russian Federation. Preservation and development of the Russian language represents the national interest of the state. The Russian language has the status of a state language, but, given the large number of ethnic groups living on the territory of Russia, it must not jeopardise other national languages, as this could lead to inter-ethnic conflicts. Some of the key issues Russia is currently facing in this field are: The process of globalisation, the uncontrolled penetration of anglicisms into the Russian language, the adverse impact of the Internet and social networks on literacy, especially with the younger population. All valid rules of the Russian orthography are, in fact, prescribed by the Government of The Russian Federation. Laws regulating the area of language policy are the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the Law on the Languages of the Peoples of the Russian Federation, and the Law on the State Language of the Russian Federation.",['University of East Sarajevo'],['Bosnia and Herzegovina'],['Kosmajac V.D.'],"['Constitution of the Russian Federation', 'Language policy', 'Laws', 'Linguistic globalisation', 'Russian language']",Filolog (Banja Luka),Faculty of Philology Banja Luka,"['Linguistics and Language', 'Language and Linguistics', 'Cultural Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,6.0,2020

An unlikely hero: Reconsidering michael ende’s momo as a divine child NEOBIČAN JUNAK: PREISPITIVANJE LIKA MOMO IZ ISTOIMENOG ROMANA MIHAELA ENDEA KAO BOŽANSKOG DETETA,"© 2020, Faculty of Philology Banja Luka. All rights reserved.The Divine Child was introduced by Carl Gustav Jung as an archetype closely linked to the process of individuation. Beyond the realm of analytical psychology, this peculiar child figure has been observed in myths and folklore and eventually evolved into a literary archetype known alternatively as das fremde Kind (the strange/alien child). Numerous child figures have since been regarded as representations of this archetype, with the titular character of Michael Ende’s novel Momo (1973) being one of them. While her initial appearance is evocative of the Divine Child, over the course of the story Momo has to accept her fate as the chosen one in a battle against a mysterious foe, ultimately finding herself in the role of the hero of the story. This paper examines the traits of both the archetype of the Divine Child, as well as that of the Hero - including a variation specific to child characters - with the goal of reconsidering if Momo is truly exemplary of the archetype of the Divine Child. This is done with particular regard to Christopher Vogler’s observation that literary archetypes are character functions, rather than fixed types, and as such this paper will discuss how Ende’s protagonist is ultimately an example of this fluidity of functions.",['University of Novi Sad'],['Serbia'],['Simurdic I.M.'],"['Alien child', 'Archetype', 'Children’s literature', 'Divine child', 'Momo']",Filolog (Banja Luka),Faculty of Philology Banja Luka,"['Linguistics and Language', 'Language and Linguistics', 'Cultural Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,32.0,2020

Equal and different: Feminism as radical humanism JEDNAKA I RAZLIČITA: FEMINIZAM KAO RADIKALNI HUMANIZAM,"© 2020, Faculty of Philology Banja Luka. All rights reserved.In its attempts to defend the right of women to claim their own subjectivity, as well as the equal right to participate in the social system institutions, the mainstream of feminist thinking has been marked crucially by the question of woman and her identity. This question could be said to occupy a central place in feminist texts and discussions which started even before the women’s movement was officially created. But since feminist disagreements about how these issues should be approached appropriately have already resulted in serious misunderstandings and mutually severe accusations, this paper aims at shedding light at the very nature of these polarities. In doing so, the focus has been placed on how the terms equal and different have been theorised. These dissenting voices have certainly proved productive in the context of theory itself, but have done much harm in the domain of social activism which failed to initiate truly substantial changes within western society and culture. The same countereffect is also visible in theory, which has generated a diversity of feminisms, but has definitely failed to offer a comprehensive critique of the perniciously repressive culture. The lack of gender equality has always been an important dimension of this culture, but still just a segment and one particular mechanism of the invisible matrix which has never actually stopped producing binary hierarchies. They are being manifested in different forms today but have retained fundamentally unchanged and unchallenged structures, promoting an ideologically induced perception of reality to appear natural and self-evident. The paper puts forward the claim that a humanistic and anti-capitalist feminism is a framework broad enough to overcome all exclusions and one-sided definitions and to head towards one such comprehensive feminism - bringing us back to the original radicalism of the women’s movement. To do so, it is necessary to reconsider the general confusion within postmodernist discourse, and especially the controversy related to what humanism should stand for today.",,,['Mitic P.V.'],"['(radical) humanism', 'Constructionism/essentialism debate', 'Dichotomous thinking', 'Feminist theory', 'Reductionist models of identity']",Filolog (Banja Luka),Faculty of Philology Banja Luka,"['Linguistics and Language', 'Language and Linguistics', 'Cultural Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,24.0,2020
Adverbs in contrast - criteria for distinguishing from other parts of speech ADVERB U KONTRASTU - KRITERIJUMI ZA RAZGRANIČENJE VRSTE REČI,"© 2020, Faculty of Philology Banja Luka. All rights reserved.This paper attempts at examining and determining, using the vast corpus of Serbian and German languages, whether the part of speech in question exists as such in each of these languages, as well as whether it (adverb) is a universal or specific language category. The research shows that most languages recognise the adverb as a distinctive part of speech, which implies that it is a universal category that can be defined according to the following criteria: A) morphological (adverbs have no flexions, but they undergo comparison with regard to the relative subclass) and syntactic (conditioned by verbs as nucleus, assuming in most cases the function of adverbials as verb complements; b) rare attributive function before nouns and adverbs themselves; c) differences between specific languages, German and Serbian included, are a result of their respective word formation systems. In this particular case, each of the two languages recognises relatively few simple words (simplizia); on the other hand, the explicit (suffixational) derivation is largely productive in Serbian, whereas there is a completely opposite situation in German concerning this issue (although the process is recorded in the latter as well); and, finally, adverb derivatives in Serbian correspond, as a rule, to adjectives and prepositional phrases functioning as adverbials in German.",,,['Petronijevic B.M.'],"['Adjective', 'Adverb', 'Adverbial', 'Circumfix', 'Derivative)', 'Prefix', 'Simplex (simple word)', 'Stem', 'Verb', 'Word formation structure (suffix']",Filolog (Banja Luka),Faculty of Philology Banja Luka,"['Linguistics and Language', 'Language and Linguistics', 'Cultural Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,20.0,2020

All rights reserved.This paper analyses the works by Branko Milanović, generated over a period of almost forty years, dedicated to the analysis of various aspects of Ivo Andrić’s literary oeuvre. Milanović is one of the most qualified interpreters of this oeuvre, given the fact that he was among the first scholars within the scope of the Yugoslav literary science to have produced a PhD dissertation on Andrić and to have published a book on his works. There are several thematic issues that mark Milanović’s prolonged interest in this matter, centred around Andrić’s literary beginnings, the atmosphere and nature of his early works, his narrative pieces featuring questions of artistic expression and the essence of art, as well as around the foundations of Andrić’s poetics, revealed in his literary works and essay and critical writing, and, finally, his novels. This analysis shows that Milanović, as early as upon acquiring his PhD title, embarks on a unique, argument-based interpretative path, constantly juxtaposing Andrić’s fiction and non-fiction.

"Speech, thought and writing representation modes in jane austen’s novel sense and sensibility","© 2020, Faculty of Philology Banja Luka. All rights reserved.Bakhtin’s views (1980:127-130) on the importance of studying speech representation and its interaction with authorial context incited prolific research in various disciplines. The research presented in this paper is based on Bakhtin’s crucial claims about speech representation, and on the theoretical framework of linguistic stylistics (Kovačević 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015; Katnić-Bakaršić 2001) and representology (Kovačević 2015:253-254). The aim of this paper is twofold—to identify the types of speech, thought and writing representation employed in the novel Sense and Sensibility and to describe their interaction with the authorial context. The method applied is‘word by word’ analysis, where in the first stage the modes of speech, thought and writing representation are identified; in the next stage their interaction with authorial context is described. The modes of speech are classified and differentiated by combining the classifications of representation modes in Serbian and English (Leech and Short 2007; Semino and Short 2004; Kovačević 2013) The results of the analysis prove that Jane Austen employs the following modes to repоrt speech, thought and writing: Indirect speech/thought/ writing, narrator’s report of speech act/ thought act/writing act, expressive indirect speech/thought, free indirect speech/thought, direct speech (monologue, dialogue, polylogue), free direct speech, line of dialogue, fragmental quote, hypothetical speech, direct thought, free direct thought, direct writing, embedded speech/thought. Predominantly, the line of interaction between authorial speech and direct speech involves the former being parenthetically embedded into foregrounded direct speech, amalgamating with the free indirect thought/speech or having as an attachment a”package” of different embedded modes of speech/ thought/writing representation. Primarily indirect thought, free indirect thought, direct thought, and free direct thought are the modes employed to characterise Elinor Dashwood, while on the other side the modes of direct speech, free direct speech, free indirect speech and direct writing combined with numerous mimetic markers prevail in depicting her sister Marianne.

Modern problems of bioethics (Review),"© 2020, Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Science. All rights reserved.The article is an analytical review of English-language articles on contemporary issues of bioethics. Ethical categories such as informed consent of the patient, the principle of freedom of choice of the subject, risk ethics, consequentialism and deontologism, etc. are considered. It is noted, in particular, that some moral principles provide an essential general point of view regarding judgments in the field of biomedical sciences, and that these principles cannot be convincingly ranked hierarchically. It is shown how the processes of specification and balancing connect broad principles and rules with specific moral judgments necessary in practical ethics. A deeper understanding of women’s experiences of fear of childbirth, interpreted through the metaphor of “being at a point where there is no return”, is demonstrated.","['Institute of Scientific Information on Social Sciences, Russian Academy of Sciences']",['Russian Federation'],['Letov O.V.'],"['Bioethics', 'Point of no return', 'Principlism', 'Right to refuse', 'Risk ethics', 'The use of artificial intelligence systems']",Filosofiya Nauki i Tehniki,"Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences",['History and Philosophy of Science'],['ARTS'],Article,0,4.0,2020
The practice of applying the activity approach and implementing the methodology of interdisciplinarity in the 60‒70 years of the twentieth century,"© 2020, Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Science. All rights reserved.Two tasks are posed in the article: First, to pay attention to the productivity of applying the activity approach in specific research and design practices of the 60‒70s of the XX century, and secondly, to analyze the possibilities of implementing the interdisciplinarity methodology in them. The sources and application of the activity approach developed in Soviet philosophy and psychology are examined, its modern criticism is given. The experience of developing interdisciplinarity is analyzed in projects implemented on the basis of the system- activity approach of E.G. Yudin for organizing ergonomic research and development, as well as formulated by E.V. Ilyenkov ideas about the activities and the emergence of consciousness on the example of the Zagorsky experiment. The fact that ergonomic studies of the second half of the last century became an experimental basis for both the study and design of activities, and the development of interdisciplinary practices is justified. The interdisciplinary interaction between philosophers, psychologists and teachers in the process of the Zagorsky experiment influenced the refinement of philosophical concepts of the nature of the ideal, its subjective forms and, in general, human consciousness The productivity of organizing special interdisciplinary research, projects and developments based on the implementation of an activity approach with the participation of specialists from different fields of knowledge studying a person is substantiated. The problem of interdisciplinarity, its origins, and modern ideas are discussed. The content of the concept of projectivity as an orientation towards the search for innovative solutions in uncertain situations, the ability to set goals, model and design a new reality is analyzed. It is concluded that interdisciplinarity and projectivity can be realized both in a strictly organized project or study, and in a communicative space in which the goals and objectives for all participants in the dialogue are not clearly formulated.","['Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences']",['Russian Federation'],['Stepanova G.B.'],"['Activity', 'Activity approach', 'Consciousness', 'Ergonomics', 'Interdisciplinarity', 'Methodology', 'Personality', 'Projectivity', 'Zagorsky experiment']",Filosofiya Nauki i Tehniki,"Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences",['History and Philosophy of Science'],['ARTS'],Article,0,24.0,2020

The analysis deals with visual representations of pioneers with Tito and the ceremony of becoming a pioneer.

The Modality analysis showed that ceremony of becoming a pioneer is a kind of initiation, a way of stepping into the world of adults.

Lexico - semantic transfer in the interlanguage of serbophone students learning italian as l2 and spanish as l3 LEKSIČKO-SEMANTIČKI TRANSFER U MEĐUJEZIKU SRBOFONIH STUDENATA KOJI UČE ITALIJANSKI KAO L2 I ŠPANSKI KAO L3,"© 2020, Faculty of Philology Banja Luka. All rights reserved.Lexical transfer, ie the influence of the student's knowledge of a word of one language on the knowledge or use of words in the target language is an important cognitive process in learning a new language students often use as a compensation strategy. This paper deals with errors in the interlanguage of L1 Serbian students learning two typologically similar languages: Italian and Spanish, which arose as a consequence of lexico - semantic transfer. The most frequent errors caused by lexico - semantic transfer were identified and classified by the method of error analysis. An extremely large number of cases of lexico-semantic transfer were found in the corpus. All errors are classified into five categories: Loan translations, semantic extension, cognates or false friends, hybrids and complete language shifts. In all cases, the negative lexical transfer occurred with words that are similar in Italian and Spanish. The errors in the written production in Spanish did not originate from the typologically distant, although the most dominant language of the students - Serbian as L1, but from the typologically similar Italian as L2. This proves the hypothesis that in typologically similar languages, lexical transfer is the most common and also that the factors of language distance and psychotypology are the key linguistic factors that will cause the transfer. Moreover, this kind of transfer was mainly used as a compensation strategy that students relied on to fill lexical gaps in situations where they did not have sufficient knowledge of the target language. Among the lexical errors, the largest number concerns cognates or false friends and hybrids. On the other hand, examples of loan translations or calques and semantic extensions were not frequent, so we conclude that the transfer of form (lexical transfer) is more frequent than the transfer of meaning (semantic transfer).",,,['Vujovic M.N.'],"['Errors', 'Interlanguage', 'Italian', 'Lexical transfer', 'Plurilingual speakers', 'Serbian', 'Spanish']",Filolog (Banja Luka),Faculty of Philology Banja Luka,"['Linguistics and Language', 'Language and Linguistics', 'Cultural Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,35.0,2020
Treatment of figurative expressions in two-way school dictionaries TRETMAN FIGURATIVNIH ZNAČENJA U DVOJEZIČNIM ŠKOLSKIM REČNICIMA,"© 2020, Faculty of Philology Banja Luka. All rights reserved.This paper deals with the selection and the lexicographic treatment of figurative expressions in two dictionaries: A French-Serbian dictionary for elementary school students and an Italian-Serbian dictionary for elementary and secondary school students. First, the corpus is processed for the purpose of quantitative comparison of figurative expressions, then 18 related words from each dictionary are singled out in order for qualitative similarities and differences to be more thoroughly examined, with, finally, the same words being analysed by means of general two-way dictionaries. The highlights of the analysis are as follows: The number of marked figurative expressions is disproportionately greater in the dictionary intended for both elementary and secondary school students; translation equivalents are identical or very similar in both school dictionaries, with the exception of the way they are marked; both school dictionaries feature examples for all figurative meanings; and, the number of figurative meanings in school dictionaries is lower than in general dictionaries, but the former show more consistence with regard to their marking and exemplifying. As far as the results are concerned, they are interpreted through the prism of lexicological, lexicographic, and didactic factors. In the end, the author conclude(s) that an appropriate treatment of figurative expressions is one of the key reasons why two-way school dictionaries are still an indispensable tool in foreign language teaching.",['University of Banja Luka'],['Bosnia and Herzegovina'],['Mikic J.M.'],"['Figurative expression', 'Foreign language teaching', 'Lexicography', 'Lexicology', 'Two-way school dictionary']",Filolog (Banja Luka),Faculty of Philology Banja Luka,"['Linguistics and Language', 'Language and Linguistics', 'Cultural Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,30.0,2020
Value-target regulations and emergence in the existential projection of the digital world,"© 2020, Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Science. All rights reserved.The article provides insight on methodological tools of post-nonclassical science from existential perspective using the example of such concepts as value-target regulations and emergence. The main goal of the article is to expand the philosophical analysis of these methodological tools by studying their transformations in the digital age. The article considers four dimensions. Firstly, it exposes the existential projection of post-nonclassical concepts. Secondly, it defines the features of value-target regulations in relation to the semantics of purpose and value. Thirdly, the article reveals the specifics of the value system transformation in the digital age. Fourthly, it analyzes the concept of emergence in the context of contemporary realities. The author identifies significant vectors of transformations in value-target regulations, among which are the priorities of technosocialization and developing digital skills; Big Data technology development and datafication. “Double updating” patterns, simulated info-presentation and multitasking characterize behavioral digital transformations. Mental transformations are based on the expanded capabilities of brain, due to the existing trends of integration with intelligent systems. The author comes to the following conclusions. Firstly, the existential projection of post-non-classical methodological tools consists in the need for a reflective analysis of goals in relation to values. This helps to bridge the gap between the logical-conceptual abstractness of methodological tools and the problems of human existence. Secondly, at present, when digital technologies are becoming the structural element of modernity, their implementation requires active subjectivity aimed at discovering the true meaning of events and affecting the use of technological innovations. Thirdly, in spite of the fact that emergence effect is inevitable, value-target regulations contribute to the introduction of “strategic reason”, humanitarian priorities and initiatives into life practices.",['Southern Federal University'],['Russian Federation'],['Leshkevich T.G.'],"['Concepts of post-nonclassical science', 'Emergence', 'Existential projection', 'Transformation of digital values', 'Value-target regulations']",Filosofiya Nauki i Tehniki,"Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences",['History and Philosophy of Science'],['ARTS'],Article,0,34.0,2020
Identification and formulation of conceptual metaphors in the corpus consisting of engineering texts in english,"© 2020, Faculty of Philology Banja Luka. All rights reserved.This paper gives a brief theoretical review of conceptual metaphors with special reference to the metaphors in scientific discourse because they are present in engineering and scientific texts. The author tried to use the theoretical framework of conceptual metaphors to detect and identify metaphors and mappings in the corpus consisting of engineering texts in English. The texts were selected according to the needs of students at the Academy of Professional Studies Šumadija, Department in Trstenik. A few bilingual and online dictionaries in the field of science and technology were also used. Although the corpus under consideration is rather small in comparison with other corpora containing millions of words, a considerable number of metaphorical expressions were discovered. All these expressions were grouped and analysed in order to establish conceptual mappings and metaphors. The results show that most of these conceptual metaphors have an anthropocentric quality in common (e.g. MACHINE PARTS ARE PARTS OF THE BODY, PARTS OF A MACHINE TOOL ARE PARTS OF THE BODY, A MATERIAL FEATURE IS A BODY FEATURE, A MACHINE FEATURE IS A HUMAN FEATURE).The paper also aims to apply these findings in the classroom activities. This can be achieved by raising metaphoric awareness of students learning engineering English. If students’ attention is explicitly drawn to the relations between the source and target domain, language learning can be facilitated. Thus, the study of metaphors can become a significant tool in the classroom in order to help students learn both technical and academic vocabulary and comprehend engineering texts written in English. Language acquisition may be higher if pedagogical potential of conceptual metaphors is used.",['Academy of Professional Studies Šumadija'],['Serbia'],['Igrutinovic S.M.'],"['Cognitive linguistics', 'Conceptual mapping', 'Conceptual metaphors', 'Engineering English', 'Source domain', 'Target domain']",Filolog (Banja Luka),Faculty of Philology Banja Luka,"['Linguistics and Language', 'Language and Linguistics', 'Cultural Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,25.0,2020
The relationship between dominance and resistance in the novel high fidelity,"© 2020, Faculty of Philology Banja Luka. All rights reserved.This paper provides an analysis of the relationship of dominance and resistance in the novel High Fidelity. The aim of the paper is to identify the elements of popular culture in the novel and thus determine the nature of possible relationships in a patriarchal, capitalist society. The theoretical framework used in the paper is Fiske’s theory of popular culture (2001) and the analysis is based on regarding the characters as representatives of dominant and resistant forces. Men and the upper class constitute categories which are dominant in the relationship with subordinate ones - women and the lower class. In addition, the protagonist Rob is the prototype of a man who is subordinate to himself, i.e. to his representation of ideal male traits he lacks, according to his own beliefs. The subordinate put up resistance in different ways. Laura is a successful business woman who possesses a strong character, which places her into a better position than that of Rob. The protagonist uses music as one of the ways to express his resistance. As a lower class member (i.e. a poor entrepreneur), the protagonist opposes upper class members (wealthy entrepreneurs) in that he possesses moral principles which they often lack.",['University of Novi Sad'],['Serbia'],['Zivanovic A.M.'],"['Dominance', 'High Fidelity', 'Popular culture', 'Resistance']",Filolog (Banja Luka),Faculty of Philology Banja Luka,"['Linguistics and Language', 'Language and Linguistics', 'Cultural Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,15.0,2020

Panopticon will be presented not as a model of a prison as it was initially intended to be, but as a concept which can be applied to the entire society. The two types of power, the power of sovereignty and disciplinary power shall be applied to the novel with the aim of finding parallels between the two mentioned systems, as well as some possible contraditions and deciding which system is in place in Nineteen Eighty-Four. Constant surveillance, establishing routines and controlling activity will be discussed in terms of mechanisms for gaining and maintaining power. Hate is seen as another mechanism for establishing power and one of the key emotions implemented in group psychology of a totalitarian regime.

"A Comparative Study on Biomass Fuel Consumption, Collection and Preference Patterns by Rural Households of Forest and Non-Forest Areas in Northern Bangladesh","© 2020, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak. All rights reserved.Biomass fuel is the most important form of renewable energy in many parts of the world including Bangladesh. Its extraction is considered as a leading cause of forest degradation of developing countries like Bangladesh. Its consumption, collection and preference patterns are thus very important indicators of overexploitation of forest. On the other hand, forests are meager in mainly northern region of Bangladesh. Reliable data and information are scanty on biomass fuel in Bangladesh, particularly in formulating its proper management plan. The aim of this study was to conduct a comparative study on the aforesaid patterns in forest and non-forest areas of northern region of Bangladesh. The study was carried out by adaptive multistage random sampling technique. A total of 90 households (45 from forest area, 45 from non-forest area) were selected randomly and based on the monthly income the households were categorized into rich, medium, poor groups. The consumption of biomass fuel was found to be differed significantly between forest (2.10 kg/capita/day) and non-forest (1.71 kg/capita/day) area. Forest, market, agriculture, homestead and roadside plantation were identified as sources of biomass fuel, and the contribution of each sources varied significantly between the areas except market. In forest area, maximum amount of biomass fuel was collected from nearby forests (44%) and poor households collected 78% of biomass fuels from the same sources. In non-forest area, roadside plantation (31%) and homesteads (24%) were the major sources of biomass fuel, and poor households collected biomass fuel mainly from roadside plantations (75%). Stems, branches, leaves, agricultural residues and cow dung were used as biomass fuel in both areas but the consumption of each biomass fuel types varied significantly except leaves. Women were identified as major biomass fuel collector and most of the biomass fuel was found to be collected during morning to noon in both areas. Most commonly used fuelwood species was Shorea robusta in forest area and Eucalyptus camaldulensis in non-forest area. The findings of this study will help policymakers to take steps in halting deforestation as well as meeting the villager’s needs for biomass fuel.",['Shahjalal University of Science and Technology'],['Bangladesh'],"['Saha N.', 'Rahman M.', 'Ador A.H.']","['angladesh', 'biomass fuel', 'forest degradation', 'fuelwood', 'homesteads', 'natural forests']",Borneo Journal of Resource Science and Technology,Universiti Malaysia Sarawak,"['Biochemistry', 'Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics', 'Water Science and Technology', 'Animal Science and Zoology', 'Biotechnology', 'Forestry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Ecology']","['AGRI', 'BIOC', 'ENVI']",Article,0,32.0,2020

These principles have emerged from almost a decade of work in communi-ties of need and are intended to guide designers working towards solutions to reduce stress and enhance health for urban families. In this paper, we examine and analyze best practices in WELL Buildings’ pandemic response guide among others, within the framework of housing, specifically single-family urban housing. Here, within the 2020 pan-demic, best practices for alleviating the challenges of the urban single-family home in an underserved community are considered. In this analysis, five areas of focus called “COVID-19 Home Signposts” have emerged and been given additional lenses of equity and access. We describe those inequities and consider how to improve pandemic housing health for those in at-risk communities.

"Perception and Healthcare seeking practices regarding dysmenorrhea among public secondary school students in Lagos, Nigeria","© BUMJ.Objectives: Dysmenorrhea is an important health problem which may have a negative impact on female health, school activities and psychological status. This study assessed the prevalence, knowledge, perception and healthcare seeking practices of dysmenorrhea among secondary school students in Lagos State, Nigeria. The pattern of management of dysmenorrhea among respondents was also assessed. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive survey was conducted among 420 adolescents in public secondary schools in Ikeja Local government area of Lagos State, Nigeria. Respondents were interviewed using a structured pretested questionnaire. Data was analyzed with SPSS Version 22.0. The level of statistical significance was set at p≤0.05. Results: Mean ± SD age at menarche was 12.3±1.3 years. The prevalence of dysmenorrhea among respondents was 75.2%. About one-quarter 106(25.2%) had good knowledge and 209(49.8%) had good perception of dysmenorrhea. Only 10% had ever sought health care for dysmenorrhea. A statistically significant association was found between the knowledge of respondents and healthcare-seeking behavior towards dysmenorrhea (p = 0.004). Conclusion: The prevalence of dysmenorrhea was high and majority of respondents had poor knowledge. Improving adolescents’ knowledge of dysmenorrhea through health education could positively influence their health care-seeking behavior.","['College of Medicine, University of Lagos', 'Lagos State University']",['Nigeria'],"['Bakare O.Q.', 'Oluwole E.O.', 'Ogunyemi A.O.', 'Agha O.O.']","['adolescents', 'Dysmenorrhea', 'healthcare-seeking practices', 'knowledge', 'perception', 'prevalence', 'secondary school students']",Babcock University Medical Journal,Babcock Medical Society,['Medicine (all)'],['MEDI'],Article,2,39.0,2020

THE MODEL OF SUPERVISION OVER ADMINISTRATIVE COURTS IN POLAND,"Copyright © 2020 Regional Association for Security and crisis management and European centre for operational research. All rights reserved.One of the most significant current discussions in Polish legal doctrine is how actions of executive powers, especially supervisory measures can affect judicial independence. It is related to basic constitutional and administrative law issues, including the separation of powers, the independence and the impartiality of the judiciary, the independence of the courts, the supervision and control, the efficiency and effectiveness of judicial protection. The analysis focuses on the dependence between the model of administrative supervision adopted in administrative justice and the efficiency of the courts, as well as their perception by the public. The study will examine supervisory measures aimed at ensuring the efficient functioning of the courts. The effectiveness of judicial review of administrative justice is essential for the protection of individuals' rights and the functioning of the state authorities in both the social and the economic sphere. From an extrajudicial point of view its significance is reflected in the influence on the judiciary, which will not only be effective in its procedural activity, but also in the level of trust and social prestige. It holds that the three arms of the state – the executive, the judiciary and the legislature – should, to a greater or lesser extent, be kept separate. That way, they are able to hold one another to account. This theory about the separation of state power went on to have a formative effect on the development of modern-day democracies. And it’s this vision of the tripartite separation of state power that is essential to the EU’s argument against the Polish reforms of the judiciary. The problem of supervision over administrative courts is also connected with external and internal independence of the judiciary. External independence refers to freedom from undue outside pressure, while internal independence protects individual judges from undue pressure from within the system. “Undue internal pressure” sometimes comes from court presidents and may take different forms: even where individual judges are not formally subordinate to court presidents or other authorities and may be result of attribution of workload, allocation of resources and benefits, disciplinary powers, powers of transfer and secondment, distribution of cases, etc. The aim of this paper is to examine the problem of supervision over administrative courts in legal system of Poland.

All Rights Reserved.International judicial dialogue is a new method of law interpretation that gains popularity in analyses of legal scholars and still raises a lot of doubts both on its existence as well as its definition. This paper will deal with the application of this technique by Polish courts. In the first place, it will be explained what international judicial dialogue actually means. Afterwards, the paper will in detail discuss problems connected to the use of this method on the basis of decisions of Polish courts, first, by presenting examples of a proper, decorative and failed dialogue, and then by emphasizing complications caused by this method in the Polish jurisprudence. It will be also explored whether there exists a real dialogue, meaning that not only Polish courts receptively refer to judgments of international and foreign courts, but there is also some level of reciprocity in those references.

SCANDINAVIAN LEGAL REALISM AND THE CHALLENGE OF RECOGNIZING EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE AS A LEGAL NORM,"© 2020 Comenius University in Bratislava Faculty of Law. All Rights Reserved.Emergency medical service (EMS) forms a sub-category of the internationally recognized right to health. However, despite the codification of the right to health in various human rights conventions which have been implemented in national legislation, EMS still seems to be regarded as an economic expense or a political decision rather than a legal norm or a human right.

GUILTY OF NOT DOING THAT!,"© 2020 Comenius University in Bratislava Faculty of Law. All Rights Reserved.Since ancient times, many legal constructions regarding blame or responsibility require subjects to be deemed accountable for their actions as well as for their omissions. The primary purpose of this work is to account for some legal and philosophical issues regarding the so-called negative events (i.e., events that have not occurred) through the development of two simple ideas. The first idea is to consider that, in most cases, a negative event is simply a normal positive event described negatively. The other idea is to distinguish the causal explanations of an event from the causal reports of an event. In this sense, it is shown how these two ideas not only clarify some fundamental philosophical issues, but they are also an excellent starting point for the interpretation and the application of some legal rules concerning omission.",['Pavol Jozef Šafárik University in Košice'],['Slovakia'],['Mazzocca M.'],"['causal omission', 'event-based perspective of law', 'events', 'negative events', 'omission', 'omission in law', 'simple omission']",Bratislava Law Review,Comenius University in Bratislava Faculty of Law,['Law'],['SOCI'],Conference Paper,0,21.0,2020
ABOUT NON-POSITIVIST PERSPECTIVE ON LEGAL VALUES IN INTERNATIONAL LAW,"© 2020 Comenius University in Bratislava Faculty of Law. All Rights Reserved.The distinction between legal and non-legal values can be made from the aspect of legal system analysis. Since the content of the legal system depends on the identification of norms that establish such content, the problem of the identification is crucial for any kind of consideration of legal values. In discourse of international legal scholars, we can recognize attempts to identify values which are not dependent on the existing social practice. The purpose of this paper is to analyse such an approach to legal values as opposite to the positivistic account of the law and to analyse the main objection to this non-positivist perspective.","['University of Zagreb, Faculty of Law']",['Croatia'],['Kresic M.'],"['constitution', 'international law', 'legal values', 'peace', 'rule of law', 'theory of law']",Bratislava Law Review,Comenius University in Bratislava Faculty of Law,['Law'],['SOCI'],Article,0,32.0,2020
INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES – A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK /,"© 2020 Comenius University in Bratislava Faculty of Law. All Rights Reserved.The paper aims to establish a conceptual framework for a relation between technological development and the international trade law. Uncovering the complex interaction between these two areas of the social reality is important today, when we are witnessing an intense period of technological revolution, which transforms not only the trade, but also the whole economy, and at the same time, it also creates challenges to the international trade law. The paper sheds light on the background of these processes and offers an introductory analysis with the aim of mapping the topic and the relevant literature. For this reason, the paper examines the roots of this context, and tries to respond the questions, what are the main challenges this revolution poses to international trade law, and how this area of law can rely upon its infrastructure to respond these challenges.","['Széchenyi István University', 'Centre for Social Sciences']",['Hungary'],['Horvathy B.'],"['autonomous vehicles', 'industry 4.0', 'international trade law, WTO', 'new technologies', 'technology and law']",Bratislava Law Review,Comenius University in Bratislava Faculty of Law,['Law'],['SOCI'],Article,0,36.0,2020
SCHREMS II: WILL IT REALLY INCREASE THE LEVEL OF PRIVACY PROTECTION AGAINST MASS SURVEILLANCE?,"© 2020 Comenius University in Bratislava Faculty of Law. All Rights Reserved.An important event that once again brought to the forefront issues related to mass surveillance was the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (hereafter referred as CJEU) delivered on July 16, 2020 in the case of Data Protection Commissioner v. Facebook Ireland Ltd. and Maximilian Schrems (Schrems II). It can be considered as the first serious precedent in the field of surveillance, which is aimed at ensuring privacy in the field of national security. Therefore, it becomes an important issue to assess its impact on the legal framework of international transfers of personal data and on the level of privacy protection. The impact of the judgment on the level of privacy protection and mass surveillance is particularly important now that CОVID-19 contact tracing programs are being widely used. In this research we try to trace the formation of the approach to mass surveillance in the case-law of CJEU before and after the Schrems II. We also try to point out some of the difficulties that the process of cross-border data transfer will face after the Schrems II. The main question of the study is whether the approach of the CJEU developed in the Schrems II will actually increase the privacy protection against mass surveillance. We conclude that the Schrems II is an important decision with serious consequences that go beyond the direct impact on data transfer between the EU and the US. It can have controversial influence of the level of privacy protection. Together with the positive trend of formation of more harmonized global data protection standards it can create many unresolved problems in the field of international data transfer and in economic dimension.",['Univerzita Palackého v Olomouci'],['Czech Republic'],"['Stehlik V.', 'Vardanyan L.']","['Court of Justice', 'EU Law', 'mass surveillance', 'privacy', 'Schrems I', 'Schrems II']",Bratislava Law Review,Comenius University in Bratislava Faculty of Law,['Law'],['SOCI'],Article,0,34.0,2020

All rights reserved.In 2004-2005, a lysimetric experiment was designed to determine whether and how plant diversity and earthworms could influence diversity and densities of collembolan communities. We compared two types of crops: monoculture of Festuca rubra L. and a polyculture, the mixture of grasses (8 species) commonly used in agriculture. In addition to two plant communities of different diversity, we used in our experiments an engineering species of earthworm – Aporrectodea caliginosa (Sav.). The experiment was initiated in May 2004, when the lysimeters were sown with F. rubra or with a mixture of grasses. The following year, in May 2005, we introduced 6 individuals (that correspond with average densities of 200 ind. m-2 in the natural environment) of A. caliginosa to half of the lysimeters. Soil samples were taken at the depths of 0-5 cm, 5-10 cm, 10-15 cm and 15-20 cm, before introducing earthworms and after 60, 120 and 180 days from introducing earthworms. We found that soil layer (Kruskal-Wallis test: N=432, H=18.25, P=0.0004), biodiversity of grass culture (N=432, H=14.59, P=0.0001) and the period of the season (N=432, H=24.24, P=0.0000) had an important effect on densities of collembolan communities independently of earthworms presence (N=432, H=1.99, P=0.16).

The Author thinks that the proposal to treat a human embryo as a deceased donor of organs, is wrong both in the field of embryology and philosophical anthropology. It is also wrong to question the subjectivity of human embryo using various criteria of growth (developed nervous system, brain, consciousness, participation in the life of society and looking after one’s own interests). For these criteria do not define humanity but describe human being in various phases of expressions of his/her human nature. That is why it is not acceptable to make the right to life conditional on the stage and degree of the actualization of humanity. Furthermore, one cannot justify the deprivation of the subjectivity of human embryo because of medical progress and the so-called good of humankind.

Unintentional transport of fungi propagules to Antarctic biome and the ability to develop at low temperatures Niezamierzony transport propaguli grzybów pleśniowych do biomu Antarktyki a zdolność rozwoju w niskich temperaturach,"© 2020, Scientific Publishing House of the Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University. All rights reserved.Filamentous fungi relatively easily disperse and colonize a variety of substrates, inhabiting various, often extreme environments. Therefore, they spread all over the world. The purpose of the research was to determine whether the propagules of filamentous fungi brought (accidentally transported) into the Antarctic biome by tourists and members of scientific expeditions are capable of developing at low temperatures. In the studies were used seven isolates of fungi: Penicillium sp., Aspergillus flavus, Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Trichoderma viride, Geotrichum candidum and Botrytis cinerea. The isolates came from samples collected from tourists and members of scientific expeditions arriving at the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island in the South Shetland archipelago. Fungal growth was measured at 0, 5, 10, 22°C (as a control) and 10° C, but after having frozen inoculum at-15°C for a period of 7 days. Penicillium sp., Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Trichoderma viride, Geotrichum candidum and Botrytis cinerea were found to be capable of growing at low temperatures (5 and 10°C as well as after one freezing cycle, down to-15°C and thawing, up to +10°C). They did not produce a macroscopically visible mycelium at temp. 0°C, however, it was not a lethal temperature for them, as when they were transferred to higher temperatures, they continued to develop even after a fairly long time following the beginning of the experiment. The most vulnerable was Aspergillus flavus. At lower temperatures (from about to 5°C) it did not develop, while freezing and thawing were lethal for this species.

The impact of revitalization treatments on biological activity of soil under afforestation on post-agricultural land Wpływ zabiegów zoo– i fitomelioracyjnych na aktywność biologiczną gleby pod zalesieniami na gruntach porolnych,"© 2020, Scientific Publishing House of the Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University. All rights reserved.In Poland, afforestation is usually carried out on the weakest soils, excluded from agricultural use and wasteland, i.e. post-agricultural land. A characteristic feature of such habitat is poor-quality soil, relatively high content of nutrients for trees, par-ticularly nitrogen, as well as a low level of humus. This is important for the quality of microbiological processes occurring in post-agri-cultural soils. Restitution of the forest in such a habitat requires the use of various revitalisation treatments for improving soil quality and increasing biological activity and soil fertility. This article presents the results of a long-term experiment on the effectiveness of various revitalisation treatments (zoo-and phytomelioration) on afforested post-agricultural lands after more than 30 years from their application in pine forests in north-western Poland. These treatments consisted of introducing additional organic matter into the soil in the form of bark and sawdust, sowing lupine and introducing soil fauna. The comparative area for afforestation on post-agricultural soils in the presented experiment was the area of forest soils, located in the same habitat, in a pine stand, at the same time. Biological activity of soil was measured with the activity of soil enzymes dehydrogenases and acid phosphatase, the biomass of microorganisms was measured and the content of total dissolved carbon and nitrogen was also determined.","['Uniwersytet Kardynala Stefana Wyszynskiego w Warszawie', 'Kampinos National Park']",['Poland'],"['Augustyniuk-Kram A.', 'Kram K.J.']","['afforestation', 'post-agricultural land', 'soil activity', 'zoo-and phytomelioration']",Studia Ecologiae et Bioethicae,Scientific Publishing House of the Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University,"['Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)', 'Health Policy', 'Environmental Science (all)', 'Philosophy']","['ARTS', 'ENVI', 'MEDI']",Article,0,44.0,2020

Ecological inspirations for the Tourism Area Life Cycle (TALC) model Ekologiczne inspiracje modelu TALC cyklu życia obszaru turystycznego,"© 2020, Scientific Publishing House of the Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University. All rights reserved.Richard Butler’s Tourism Area Life Cycle (TALC) model proposes a specified view on the qualitative changes in the number of tourists N in the area over time and the environmental, social and economic processes taking place there simultaneously. N changes follow S-shaped curve up to stagnation phase. Such a course was adopted in the TALC model, assuming that the tourist population at this stage develops in accordance with a logistic model derived from ecology. This work aimed to recall the properties of the logistic model and the ecological assumptions underlying it, and some of the consequences of incorporating the logistic model into the TALC model. An attempt has also been made to link other TALC aspects with ecology. In particular, reference is made to the graph on the right side of the logistic equation of the TALC model as a function of N with the phases of evolution of the tourist area marked, which reminds that the most attractive area is the original area, i.e. when N is small, as it is characterized by the highest per capita growth of the tourist population. According to this figure, as N increases, there is a linear decrease in attractiveness despite the investments introduced according to the TALC model scenario, i.e. they do not reverse this trend. The same diagram can be used to show some elementary differences between ecotourism and mass tourism. The issues of population regulation were also raised, including the density-dependent self-regulation, the Allee effect, the concept of environmental capacity and r and K strategies. It was also pointed out that the experience gained in the field of population modelling in ecology could help to model tourist populations.",['Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego Józefa Piłsudskiego w Warszawie'],['Poland'],['Szeligiewicz W.'],"['density-dependent effects', 'ecotourism', 'mass tourism', 'population regulation', 'r and K strategy', 'TALC model', 'touristic area', 'tourists']",Studia Ecologiae et Bioethicae,Scientific Publishing House of the Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University,"['Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)', 'Health Policy', 'Environmental Science (all)', 'Philosophy']","['ARTS', 'ENVI', 'MEDI']",Article,0,50.0,2020

Axiological principles of integrated protection of human and natural environments Aksjologiczne podstawy integralnej ochrony środowiska przyrodniczego i ludzkiego,"© 2020, Scientific Publishing House of the Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University. All rights reserved.Over the last few decades, we have witnessed a significant change in human mentality and attitudes towards the natural environment and its protection. This change is accompanied by different axiological principles within which we can distin-guish: 1) the anthropocentric concept which places man in the centre and grants him a privileged place amongst other species; 2) the anti-anthropocentric concept which stresses the equality of all species and demands a reversal in humanistic orientation consolidated by the European Enlightenment; 3) the moderate anthropocentric concept which underlines human’s caring and a responsible role towards the ecosystem. As disturbances of ecological balance are the result of human actions and the sign of the cultural crisis, the necessity to protect the natural environment should be realised. John Paul II was a supporter of the above. He referred to the integrated ecology, which combines the protection of the natural environment with the concern of the quality of human spirituality. Integrated ecology poses two demands: 1) all actions towards environmental protection should be under-stood as means of confirming the respect of human personal dignity; 2) those actions which harm the natural environment and threaten man should be given up.",['Uniwersytet Kardynala Stefana Wyszynskiego w Warszawie'],['Poland'],['Boloz W.'],"['anthropocentrism', 'biocentrism', 'human dignity', 'human rights', 'moderate anthropocentrism']",Studia Ecologiae et Bioethicae,Scientific Publishing House of the Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University,"['Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)', 'Health Policy', 'Environmental Science (all)', 'Philosophy']","['ARTS', 'ENVI', 'MEDI']",Article,0,20.0,2020

Environmental economics – a modern science with traditions Ekonomia środowiskowa – współczesna nauka z tradycjami,"© 2020, Scientific Publishing House of the Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University. All rights reserved.The fact that problems of environmental degradation and its protection are gaining importance is caused, among others, by limitations in management efficiency. It forces us to look at economic processes with consideration of output of such disciplines that indicate how one should manage in a situation of reduced availability of natural resources. Such discipline, without any doubts, is environmental protection. This science indicates methods and economic instruments that can be applied in economic practice necessary for environmental protection. It deals also with problems related to economic studies of implications of environmental policies. At the same environmental economics that results from neoclassical trend of economics looking at the market as unfailing mechanism of economic regulation proves that invisible hand of market fails in case of environmental protection.

Environmental vices as ethical and anthropological roots of the environmental crisis Wady środowiskowe jako etyczne i antropologiczne źródła kryzysu środowiskowego,"© 2020, Scientific Publishing House of the Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University. All rights reserved.The root of environmental crisis is not only the failure to recognize the intrinsic value of the non-human world, but it can also be perceived as a failure in moral excellence and in the cultivation of virtue. The word “virtue” is an old-fashioned one, repre-senting tradition and today we mostly associate it with academic discussion. However, the term is not only connected with traditional ethical reflection; nowadays, we can witness a revival of virtue discourse in environmental ethics, namely in environmental virtue ethics.

All rights reserved.The results presented here concern the study, which was carried out in the spring of 2009 on an arable field and a fallow. Following parameters were analysed: density, taxonomic composition, trophic and dominance structure of soil nematode communities. Shannon-Weaver diversity index, Sørensen’s index of similarity and Maturity index were also calculated. The results show that the nematode community in the soil of arable field differed from that on the fallow in respect of density and trophic structure. Nematode density was higher in the arable soil than in the fallow. The group of bacterial-feeding nematodes was the most numerous among five trophic groups recorded in the study. The higher density of that group in the arable soil than in the fallow indicates the positive response of bacterial-feeding nematodes to the higher nutrient supply after the manure applying. The results show that in three years of fallow nematode communities became more mature and diverse than in the arable soil.

Muskrats inhabited mostly small and medium rivers in the western part of the study area. The decrease in the occurrence of the species over a study period is the best document by a significant reduction in the frequency of muskrat records at the 249 sites surveyed in 1996-1998 (present at 44% sites) and 2007 (7%).

Humans strive for satisfactory life of appropriate quality, and often have to make choices between various goods. Unfortunately, ecological properties are very often treated last of all in the decision-making hierarchy, and are usually considered inferior to, for example, material prosperity or social comfort. Treating the ecological properties as such, often results in them going unnoticed overall, and very soon leads to permanent and negative changes that directly affect human life and the environment, as well as having a negative effect on health. Therefore, such extraordinarily essentiaconditions for choosing and fulfilling ecological needs as regards first-class existential needs that have a vital influence on the quality of life and ecological awareness, are based chiefly on understanding the rules of sustainable development. Should the development of civilisation be ruled by economy, or should the basis of that development be protection and maintenance of natural environmental resources? Or maybe the most sensible option is to balance economic, social and ecological aims?

"Wetland birds of middle Vistula River during breeding season: the impact of human activities on the distribution, abundance and richness of species Awifauna wodno-błotna środkowej Wisły w okresie lęgowym: wpływ działalności człowieka na rozmieszczenie, liczebność i bogactwo gatunkowe","© 2020, Scientific Publishing House of the Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University. All rights reserved.The inventory of birds was conducted in the years 2005-2010 on the Vistula River section between Dęblin (km 388 of the river) and Podwierzbie (km 435 of the river). The study area includes a southern section of the European Ecological Natura 2000 Site in Poland PLB140004 “Middle Vistula River Valley” (IBA, PL083). On most areas the Vistula flows here within unregulated or relatively little modified riverbed, having features of a natural, lowland, braided river. Sandy islands and braid bars within a main channel, steep banks and old riparian afforestation create the unique breeding habitats of the Vistula River Valley. Especially the river channel habitats provide suitable breeding sites for many rare bird species, constituting for some of them the key-breeding sites. There are, however, fragments of several kilometres, where people transformed the Vistula River in a more noticeable way (Table 1). These are, among others: an urban section within Dęblin boundaries (km 388 to km 393 of the river), a fragment adjacent to Kozienice Power Plant (km 421 to km 426) and the area, where since 2007 gravel for industry has been mined from the river bottom (km 426 to km 431). The aim of this inventory was the comparison of richness and abundance of breeding bird species linked directly to the river channel in fragments mentioned above. It will allow to estimate soberly how very the intensity of human utilization of the river affects the distribution of avifauna of the Vistula, determining the richness and abundance of valuable and/or endangered species breeding in a given area. In the years 2007-2009 within a whole study area 32 breeding species characteristic for the riverbed and its surroundings were recorded. Among them 6 are threatened in Poland: mew gull (Larus canus), little tern (Sternula albifrons), ringed plover (Charadrius hiaticula), Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus), corncrake (Crex crex) and hoopoe (Upupa epops) (Table 2a, b). The comparison of bird richness revealed significant differences between adjoining fragments of the river (Table 3). Decidedly the most valuable was the section between Wróble and Kozienice Power Plant (km 416-421). The Vistula River flows here within a riverbed only a little changed by man. It has an appearance typical for a large, lowland braided river with meandering channels, network of small side channels, steep banks, sandy bars and different kind of islands. Such differentiated environment is reflected in richness of birds. The association of 27-30 species reached here the total density of 337-397 pairs/km along the river, unparalleled in other habitats (Table 3). The urban section within Dęblin boundaries (km 388-393) and a 5-kilometer-long area of gravel mining (km 426-431) were much less attractive for birds. Straight, much narrower river channel, small number of islands in a main channel and a degraded valley in the vicinity of river banks caused, that only six to ten species nested there, of the total density ranged between 2.0-2.7 pairs/km on the urban fragment and 3.8-6.6 pairs/km within the gravel pit area (Table 3). However, these values are quite high in comparison to those recorded for the fragment adjoining Kozienice Power Plant (km 421-426). The river channel is here clearly contracted and the bottom is deepened. The river flows fast within one channel. Numerous, concrete, submerged groynes, revetments on both sides of the river and a bank made of concrete, protecting a power station are very characteristic for this place. Such a man-made environment almost excludes the possibility of breeding of birds within a riverbed. Only single pairs of lapwings (Vanellus vanellus), common sandpipers (Actitis hypoleucos), little ringed plovers (Charadrius dubius) and goosanders (Mergus merganser) occurred here, sporadically also common terns (Sterna hirundo) (Table 2a,b). The total density was very low and did not exceed 1.5 pairs/km along the river. The yearly surveys of birds in the years previous to and after beginning of a gravel and sand mining from the river bottom allowed to estimate if the development had changed somehow the status of riparian bird populations. During three years of an activity a negative impact of the development on the richness and abundance of bird species was not recorded, both in direct vicinity and on the fragment below (Table 4). Not the small harmfulness of the development finally influences the status and changes of avifauna in these sections, but the place where it is situated. It should be kept in mind that the sand mining takes place only within 2 km of the section of Vistula that is regulated to a large degree, and the section above is almost unavailable for riparian birds (Kozienice Power Station). One can assume with high probability bordering on certainty that when the gravel excavation took place on the fragment between km 393 and km 421 or below km 431 of the river, the negative impact of the development on breeding habitats and avifauna of the river channel would be much more noticeable and worse still – it would be irreversible. Both fragments mentioned above are now unique places, where the bird association characteristic for the unregulated channel of lowland river can be found – the environment, which irrevocably declines due to human activities.","['Uniwersytet Kardynala Stefana Wyszynskiego w Warszawie', 'Polish Academy of Sciences']",['Poland'],"['Buczynski A.', 'Bukacinski D.', 'Bukacinska M.']","['avifauna of Vistula River', 'gravel and sand mining', 'river regulation', 'threats for riparian birds']",Studia Ecologiae et Bioethicae,Scientific Publishing House of the Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University,"['Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)', 'Health Policy', 'Environmental Science (all)', 'Philosophy']","['ARTS', 'ENVI', 'MEDI']",Article,1,11.0,2020

All rights reserved.Fire incidence is a big problem for every local government unit in the Philippines. The two most detrimental effects of fire incidence are economic loss and loss of life. To mitigate these losses, proper planning and implementation of control measures must be done. An essential aspect of planning and control measures is prediction of possible fire incidences. This study is conducted to analyze the historical data to create a forecasting model for the fire incidence in Davao City. Results of the analyses show that fire incidence has no trend or seasonality, and occurrences of fire are neither consistently increasing nor decreasing over time. Furthermore, the absence of seasonality in the data indicate that surge of fire incidence may occur at any time of the year.

In the present study, morphometric and histological changes in mucous cells of the skin during reproductive migration were studied. The thickness of the epidermis was found to be thicker in the freshwater than in the lake environment. It has been determined that both the diameter and the chemical content of the mucus cell vary in different aquatic environments (freshwater and lakes). For this reason, it is thought that mucus cells are present in different types in the skin of Van fish. Also, these changes are different in several parts of the body (dorsal and lateral).

In this study, five substrate types were determined as particularly according to their habitat preference. In this study, the preference of fine-grained soils is found more adaptive because the pits are constructed in these substrates are more functional for longer periods and they are much more successful in trapping their prey than the coarse-grained soil pits. Furthermore, it was found that there is a direct relationship between the pit size and substrate particle structure. Therefore, the detection and selection of microhabitats under more convenient ecological conditions, which increase capture success and elucidate the hunting strategy, may be carried out during strong soil substrate selection for Myrmeleon Linnaeus species.

Lorenz recommended mobilizing efforts to create an ecological ethos for those surviving on Earth. Today it isn’t possible to predict the future of Homo sapiens on our planet, however, it is our duty to prepare for our struggle to survive. It is not only about survival but also about the preservation of the human way of life. This is a matter of biological and spiritual survival.

The myth of responsiveness. Discourse analysis on the indirect effectiveness of building orders and planning-law expropriations Der Mythos der Drohkulisse. Eine diskursanalytische Untersuchung der Instrumente Baugebot und städtebauliche Enteignung in der responsiven Bodenpolitik,"© 2020 Michael Kolocek, Andreas Hengstermann, published by Sciendo.Building orders and planning-law expropriations are viewed as particularly interventionist instruments of the Federal Building Code. The two instruments share another characteristic in addition to this high degree of interventionism, namely that they are rarely used in practice. This is due to the theory of responsive land policy, which suggests that less interventionist instruments should be applied first. However, these latter instruments are effective because all those involved, and particularly the affected parties, are aware of the existence of the more intensive options. Municipal decision-making instances thus profit from the provision of building orders and, in particular, expropriation as the ‘ultima ratio’ of planning law. The responsive approach is nonetheless only possible when those affected are aware of, or are made aware of, the existence of the more interventionist instruments. This article presents the results of a discourse analysis of 300 newspapers from the past 25 years. The analysis investigates the hypothesis that the decision-making instances mention building orders and expropriation in these media so as to exercise indirect influence in advance, and thus attempt to persuade those involved to cooperate. The analysis shows that the municipalities also use the local media to consider the use of building orders and expropriation. Often the actual application of the instruments is relativised in the same article by other decisions (for instance by the opposition), independent experts or editorial comments.","['University of Bern', 'Technische Universität Dortmund']","['Switzerland', 'Germany']","['Hengstermann A.', 'Kolocek M.']","['Building order', 'Discourse analysis', 'Housing Policy', 'Planning law', 'Responsive land policy', 'Urban expropriation']",Raumforschung und Raumordnung,Oekom - Gesellschaft fuer Oekologische Kommunikation mbH,"['Environmental Science (miscellaneous)', 'Urban Studies', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","['SOCI', 'ENVI']",Article,1,42.0,2020
EVIL AND FREE WILL: CONTEMPORARY FREE-WILL DEFENSE AND CLASSICAL THEISM,"© 2020, National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics. All rights reserved.The article considers contemporary free will defenses, proposed by A. Plantinga, R. Swinburne, according to which the existence of a world in which there is free will is something more valuable than the existence of a world in which there is no free will. It is shown that contemporary forms of free will defenses share with atheistic arguments from evil an anthropomorphic model of God, in which God is thought as an individual among other individuals, although endowed with attributes such as omniscience and omnipotence to an excellent degree. It has also been shown that another important point of similarity between contemporary free will defenses and atheistic arguments from evil is that both attempt to assess what our world would be like if created by such an individual. In contrast to atheistic arguments from evil, contemporary free will defenses argue that divine omnipotence and omniscience are subject to some greater restrictions, as usually assumed, especially due to God’s desire to give some of his creations the ability of free choice, which logically implies the possibility and even necessity of the existence of evil. It is demonstrated that classical theism does not share the anthropomorphic model of deity typical for many contemporary philosophers of religion. The classical theism rejects both the anthropomorphic model of deity and the unaccountability of free will to God as the supreme good. On the contrary, it assumes that free decision was initially an opportunity for the voluntary consent of man which had an innate aspiration towards God as his supreme good. Nevertheless, due to the creation of man out of nothing, this consent could not be automatic, but implied forming a virtuous character, and man’s transition from a state in which he was able not to sin, to a state in which he would be not able to sin.",['Voronezh N.

Functional classification of small towns in Germany. A methodological comparison Funktionale Klassifizierung von Kleinstädten in Deutschland. Ein methodischer Vergleich,"© 2020 Philipp Gareis, Antonia Milbert, published by Sciendo.The development of small towns in Germany in terms of their economic, demographic and social endowment is a subject area that has been rather neglected so far. What is more, research often focuses exclusively on small towns in rural and peripheral regions, because this is the only place where they are assigned a certain role. Small towns in central areas, on the other hand, are subsumed under suburbia in research and are thus rarely considered in terms of their specific functions. In this paper, all small towns in Germany are classified with regard to important functions. The typification is done by means of a cluster analysis based on central factors, which in turn are tied to a broad set of indicators. Reference points are the classical method of principal component analysis and, as an alternative method, to geographically weighted principal component analysis. The methodological comparison shows that the alternative method – also due to the high computational effort – is not yet a suitable method for describing spatial relationships between the variables and for small towns with regard to existing functions in their surrounding areas. On the other hand, the approach of the principal component analysis, cluster analysis and discriminant analysis, which is found in the literature, produces well defined and explainable solutions for the formation of different types of small towns in Germany.","['Stadt-und Raumforschung', 'Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen']",['Germany'],"['Milbert A.', 'Gareis P.']","['Cluster analysis', 'Functional classification', 'Geographically weighted principal component analysis', 'Principal component analysis', 'Small town']",Raumforschung und Raumordnung,Oekom - Gesellschaft fuer Oekologische Kommunikation mbH,"['Environmental Science (miscellaneous)', 'Urban Studies', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","['SOCI', 'ENVI']",Article,5,58.0,2020
HOW TO BELIEVE FAITHFULLY AND FIRMLY?,"© 2020, National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics. All rights reserved.Religious people are expected to believe in their religious creeds faithfully and frmly. How can one acquire such belief? In order to answer that question, I propose a model for all belief-like propositional attitudes. The model diferentiates, frstly, between voluntary and involuntary, and, secondly, between categorical and quantitative belief-like attitudes. The whole variety of belief-like attitudes is then reduced into two main groups. The frst group combines all voluntary and categorical attitudes, and the second group combines all involuntary and quantitative attitudes. The resultant frst-group attitude is called “judgment,” and the second-group attitude—“confdence.” Thus, judgment is the generic voluntary categorical propositional attitude, which can have only two values: “true” or “false.” Confdence is the generic involuntary quantitative attitude, which can have any value between “certainly false” and “certainly true.” A religious person can form the creedal judgment simply by her act of will, while her confidence depends upon the actual content of her doxastic system. However, a person can indirectly increase her confidence in the creedal statement via relevant factors that control her doxastic system. Such factors include corroboration, desirability, and ethicality of the proposition, and also its centrality and entrenchment in the doxastic system. I suggest several practical guidelines for increasing the relevant factors. I claim that the suggested model and the practical guidelines for acquiring the “faithful and firm belief” can be used not only within the religious context, but can also be applied to any propositional beliefs.","['Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences']",['Russian Federation'],['Butakov P.'],"['Belief', 'Credence', 'Degrees of Belief', 'Doxastic Involuntarism', 'Doxastic System', 'Doxastic Voluntarism', 'Propositional Attitudes']",Filosofiya.

The naive understanding of analysis as the mental decomposition of anything into any parts is criticized. It is opposed by the assertion that at the analytical stage of the study of an object we gain the knowledge about its components, and at the synthetic stage we gain the knowledge about those relationships that combine these components into a whole object. A generalized understanding of synthesis as a knowledge of relations between any objects and analysis as a knowledge of the carriers of these relations is introduced. Based on the material of the history of the study of value relations - Wertverhaltnis - the epistemological mechanism of a holistic analytical and synthetic research is investigated.

Doubly relevant: Critical infrastructures of Daseinsvorsorge Doppelt relevant: Kritische Infrastrukturen der Daseinsvorsorge,"© 2020 Susanne Krings, published by Sciendo.Spatial planning is called on to contribute to managing risks associated with outages of infrastructure services deemed particularly important in the context of critical infrastructure protection. This paper explores indications of overlaps between critical infrastructure sectors and the fields of Daseinsvorsorge (services of general interests) which have not yet received much attention in expert discussions. It provides a comparison of critical infrastructure sectors and variants of lists of the fields of Daseinsvorsorge. Although the extent of the overlaps cannot be determi-ned exactly, it can be assumed that most of the infrastructures considered to be critical are involved in the provision of services associated with the concept of Daseinsvorsorge. Hence the infrastructures and services in question are subject to different policy areas and interventions carried out in accordance with them. This inference calls for consideration of the implications of the spatial organization of the provision of Daseinsvorsorge services for critical infrastructure protection. A change of perspective, i.e. looking at the aims and means of Daseinsvorsorge planning from the point of view of critical infrastructure protection, enhances the visibility of their potential ‘side effects’. As the concept of critical infrastructure incorporates both worthiness of protection and a certain hazard potential, a change of perspective leads to unfamiliar perceptions of the spatial planning of Daseinsvorsorge and raises academic and practical questions.",['Universität Bonn'],['Germany'],['Krings S.'],"['Critical infrastructure', 'Germany', 'Risk management', 'Services of general interest', 'Spatial planning']",Raumforschung und Raumordnung,Oekom - Gesellschaft fuer Oekologische Kommunikation mbH,"['Environmental Science (miscellaneous)', 'Urban Studies', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","['SOCI', 'ENVI']",Article,3,77.0,2020
Ecology through the eyes of a non-ecologist Ekologia oczami nieekologa,"© 2020, Scientific Publishing House of the Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University. All rights reserved.Ecology is a branch of biology that deals with the life of plants and animals in their environment. Nature protection are practical actions where ecology is applied. Ecology is the most biological branch of biology because it deals with individuals in their living environment, and individuals “exist” only in biology. The most important issue being considered in ecology is biodiversity: its changes and its persistence. In their research, ecologists focus on the functioning of ecological systems. In classical terms, they assume that the most important mechanism is density dependence. Mathematical models traditionally applied in ecology include ordinary difference and differential equations, which fits well with the assumption of density dependence, but this results in ecology being dominated by considerations of the stability of ecological systems. Evolutionary biology and ecology have separate areas of interest. Evolutionary biology explains the formation of optimal characteristics of individuals. Ecology also takes into account those individuals who have lost in the process of natural selection. The mathematical methods used in classical ecology were developed for the use of physics. The question arises whether they give a precise picture of the dynamics of ecological systems. Recently, a view has emerged stating that in order to see the importance of full-scale biodiversity, we should refer to individuals (rather than population density) as basic “atoms” that make up ecological systems.

The Control of Panicle Blight Bacterial Pathogen on Rice Seeds Through In Vitro Treatments,"© 2020, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak. All rights reserved.Burkholderia glumae is a seed-borne pathogen of rice known to cause bacterial panicle blight disease. The lack of effective control methods makes seed treatment the alternative management approach. The aim of this research was to determine an effective seed treatments technique, using liquid smoke, clove oil, hot water and copper hydroxide fungicide treatment against bacteria B. glumae. The experiment used a complete randomized design with five treatments and three replications, including control, liquid smoke, clove oil, hot water, and copper hydroxide fungicide. The results showed the propensity for all treatments to reduce bacterial populations on rice seeds, while liquid smoke, clove oil, and fungicide did not reduce vigour and viability. Application of copper hydroxide fungicide 77% at concentration of 5% was recommended as the best treatment to control the bacterial pathogen.",['Universitas Sumatera Utara'],['Indonesia'],"['Lisnawita', 'Utari U.', 'Safni I.', 'Tobing M.C.']","['Burkholderia glumae', 'clove oil', 'copper hydroxide fungicide', 'hot water', 'liquid smoke', 'rice']",Borneo Journal of Resource Science and Technology,Universiti Malaysia Sarawak,"['Biochemistry', 'Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics', 'Water Science and Technology', 'Animal Science and Zoology', 'Biotechnology', 'Forestry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Ecology']","['AGRI', 'BIOC', 'ENVI']",Article,1,34.0,2020
Dohnányi's Orchestrations of Schubert's Fantasy in F Minor and the Moments musicaux Piano Cycle,"© 2020 The Author(s).Ernst von Dohnányi's brilliant instrumentation skills were already recognized by his contemporaries. His former disciple and first monographer Bálint Vázsonyi published an anecdote, according to which Béla Bartók considered the orchestral version of Ruralia hungarica (op. 32) as the first truly ""orchestrated""Hungarian symphonic work. Nevertheless, neither Dohnányi's own orchestration practices nor the transcriptions he prepared for symphony orchestra from the works of other composers have been studied. This paper examines two of these orchestrations, made in 1928 on the occasion of the Schubert Centenary-Dohnányi's orchestral transcriptions of the Fantasy in F Minor, originally written for piano four hands, and the piano cycle Moments musicaux-both being virtually unknown to the public. The analysis also provides an insight into Dohnányi's interpretation of Schubert, including his approach to the Austrian composer.",['Institute for Musicology'],['Hungary'],['Laskai A.'],"['Ernst von Dohnányi', 'Fantasy in F Minor for piano duet (D. 940)', 'Franz Schubert', 'Moments musicaux (D. 780)', 'orchestration']",Studia Musicologica,Akademiai Kiado ZRt.,['Music'],['ARTS'],Article,0,12.0,2020
In-vitro antisickling and sickling-reversal activities of Carica papaya fruit at different stages of ripening,"© BUMJ. 2020.Objective: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a haemoglobinopathy that causes several clinical complications. Unripe Carica papaya has been shown to possess antisickling activity that could reduce these complications. This study aimed to examine the presence of antisickling and sickling-reversal activities of aqueous extracts and ethyl acetate fractions of C. papaya fruit at different stages of ripening. Methods: Unripe, partly ripe and fully ripe fruits were quantitatively screened for some phytochemicals using standard methods. Blood samples from sickle cell patients were used to investigate antisickling and sickling reversal activities of aqueous extracts and ethyl acetate fractions of the fruits. Data were analysed using one-way ANOVA. p-value was set at 0.05. Results: Phytochemicals such as alkaloids, saponins, tannins, flavonoids and polyphenols were found in varying concentrations in C. papaya fruit at the different stages of ripening. All extracts and fractions showed antisickling and sickling-reversal activities with the ethyl acetate fraction of partly ripe C. papaya being most effective. Conclusion: The study showed that C. papaya fruit at different stages of ripening contains antisickling and sickling-reversal activities which may help reduce the associated complications of SCD when consumed by affected individuals.",['Babcock University'],['Nigeria'],"['Oyelese A.T.', 'Adetayo Modupe O.', 'Adetayo A.M.', 'Shokunbi O.S.']","['Anti-sickling', 'Carica papaya', 'Phytochemical', 'Sickling-Reversal']",Babcock University Medical Journal,Babcock Medical Society,['Medicine (all)'],['MEDI'],Article,2,32.0,2020

Turkey has also regulations and serious penalties about GMOs and its product-usage so it is also questioned by forensic sciences. The purpose of this study is to investigate the current situation by making GMO analyses in risky product groups. Products containing corn and soy content, known as risky product groups, were obtained from markets in Istanbul. GMO screening analysis of 35 products selected between July-September 2018 was performed by Real-Time PCR method. Positive results were detected in 2 animal feed samples. In these samples, the amount of GMO (35S region) was determined as below 0.1%.

The influence of cultural factors on the collapse of the Greenland Norse civilization Wpływ czynników kulturowych na upadek cywilizacji grenlandzkich Wikingów,"© 2020, Scientific Publishing House of the Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University. All rights reserved.The understanding of the collapse of ancient civilizations is important for the understanding of very complex process happening in our civilization. The Earth is put in danger due to many reasons and some of them do not change throughout history. Because of the global range of human actions, the power reached by contemporary man is much more dangerous than it used to be centuries ago. Therefore, the understanding of the past collapses is crucial for the safety of our global village. The article shows the reasons for the collapse of the Greenland Norse civilization. It seems that the main reason was climate change but it also seems that the Greenland Norse could have survived, or at least postponed the collapse. The author indicates that cultural factors were the roots of ecological degradation and the lack of economic adaptation. The Norse knew the Inuit and their adaptive strategies but did not learn from them. It seems that the collapse of the Greenland Norse civilization was the choice of the Norse’s elite. The leaders kept the society in a risky balance in order to rule over them, but finally, the fragile equilibrium was shattered and caused the collapse.",['Uniwersytet Kardynala Stefana Wyszynskiego w Warszawie'],['Poland'],['Sadowski R.F.'],"['civilization collapse', 'cultural factors', 'environmental factors', 'Greenland', 'Greenland Norse']",Studia Ecologiae et Bioethicae,Scientific Publishing House of the Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University,"['Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)', 'Health Policy', 'Environmental Science (all)', 'Philosophy']","['ARTS', 'ENVI', 'MEDI']",Article,1,19.0,2020

All rights reserved.A model of predator-prey interaction in a chemostat with Holling Type II predator functional response of the Monod or Michaelis-Menten form, is considered. It is proved that local asymptotic stability of the coexistence equilibrium implies that it is globally asymptotically stable. It is also shown that when the coexistence equilibrium exists, but is unstable, solutions converge to a unique, orbitally asymptotically stable periodic orbit. Thus the range of the dynamics of the chemostat predator-prey model is the same as for the analogous classical Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model with Holling Type II functional response. An extension that applies to other functional responses is also given.","['McMaster University, Faculty of Science']",['Canada'],"['Bolger T.', 'Wolkowicz G.S.K.', 'Hill M.', 'Eastman B.']","['chemostat', 'global dynamics', 'Hopf bifurcation', 'Monod form', 'predator-prey system']",Mathematics in Applied Sciences and Engineering,Western University Libraries,"['Modeling and Simulation', 'Applied Mathematics']",['MATH'],Article,1,39.0,2022
HIGH-ORDER MIMETIC DIFFERENCE SIMULATION OF UNSATURATED FLOW USING RICHARDS EQUATION,"© 2022 Mathematics in Applied Sciences and Engineering. All rights reserved.The vadose zone is the portion of the subsurface above the water table and its pore space usually contains air and water. Due to the presence of infiltration, erosion, plant growth, microbiota, contaminant transport, aquifer recharge, and discharge to surface water, it is crucial to predict the transport rate of water and other substances within this zone. However, flow in the vadose zone has many complications as the parameters that control it are extremely sensitive to the saturation of the media, leading to a nonlinear problem. This flow is referred as unsaturated flow and is governed by Richards equation. Analytical solutions for this equation exists only for simplified cases, so most practical situations require a numerical solution. Nevertheless, the nonlinear nature of Richards equation introduces challenges that causes numerical solutions for this problem to be computationally expensive and, in some cases, unreliable. High-order mimetic finite difference operators are discrete analogs of the continuous differential operators and have been extensively used in the fields of fluid and solid mechanics. In this work, we present a numerical approach involving high-order mimetic operators along with a Newton root-finding algorithm for the treatment of the nonlinear component. Fully-implicit time discretization scheme is used to deal with the problem’s stiffness.",['San Diego State University'],['United States'],"['Boada A.', 'Castillo J.', 'Corbino J.']","['Mimetic operators', 'Nonlinear partial differential equations', 'Richards equation', 'Unsaturated flow']",Mathematics in Applied Sciences and Engineering,Western University Libraries,"['Modeling and Simulation', 'Applied Mathematics']",['MATH'],Article,0,11.0,2022

A FAMILY OF QUASI-VARIABLE MESHES HIGH-RESOLUTION COMPACT OPERATOR SCHEME FOR BURGER’S-HUXLEY AND BURGER’S-FISHER EQUATION,© 2022 Mathematics in Applied Sciences and Engineering. All rights reserved.We describe a quasi-variable meshes implicit compact finite-difference discretization having an accuracy of order four in the spatial direction and second-order in the temporal direction for obtaining numerical solution values of generalized Burger’s-Huxley and Burger’s-Fisher equations. The new difference scheme is derived for a general one-dimension nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation on a quasi-variable meshes network. The magnitude of local truncation error of the high-order compact scheme remains unchanged in the case of a uniform mesh. Quasi-variable meshes high-order compact formulation yield a more precise solution than uniform meshes high-order schemes of the same magnitude. A detailed exposition of the new scheme has been introduced and discussed the Fourier stability theory. The computational results with generalized Burger’s-Huxley equation and Burger’s-Fisher equation are obtained using a quasi-variable meshes high-order compact scheme. It is compared with a numerical solution using uniform meshes high-order schemes to demonstrate capability and accuracy.,['South Asian University'],['India'],"['Jha N.', 'Wagley M.']","['Compact scheme', 'Generalized Burgers equation', 'Ilkovič’s equation', 'Maximum-absolute-errors', 'Quasi-variable mesh', 'Stability']",Mathematics in Applied Sciences and Engineering,Western University Libraries,"['Modeling and Simulation', 'Applied Mathematics']",['MATH'],Article,1,46.0,2022
TRANSIENT DYNAMICS OF THE KIDNEY DISEASE EPIDEMIC AMONG HIV-INFECTED INDIVIDUALS,"© 2022 Mathematics in Applied Sciences and Engineering. All rights reserved.The prevalence of end stage kidney disease (ESKD) is rising among HIV-infected populations in several regions worldwide. We used an ordinary differential equation model of the dynamics of the AIDS and HIV+ ESKD populations to investigate the effect of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on the transient dynamics of the epidemic. We considered ART that blocks the entry to each population, by preventing individuals from joining the AIDS population and by reducing the development from AIDS to HIV+ ESKD, as well as the combined effects together. Numerical simulation of our model revealed that at certain levels of ART below 100%, the prevalence of HIV+ ESKD drops, but then increases again due to the recovery in the AIDS population. We then examined the dip in HIV+ ESKD seen with ART analytically by calculating the minimum HIV+ ESKD level and the length of time to achieve this minimum. We also evaluated the minimum HIV+ ESKD level and its dependence on ART parameters, both singly and in combination. We conclude that our model predicts that the drop in HIV+ ESKD prevalence seen after increased ART will be followed by an increase, unless ART is sufficiently high enough to eradicate HIV/AIDS.","['Washington State University Pullman', 'Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence deemed to be University']","['India', 'United States']","['Keshavamurthy R.', 'Schwartz E.J.', 'Hull-Nye D.', 'Malik B.']","['continuous ODE epidemic model', 'transient dynamics']",Mathematics in Applied Sciences and Engineering,Western University Libraries,"['Modeling and Simulation', 'Applied Mathematics']",['MATH'],Article,0,28.0,2022
CONTROLLING RABIES EPIDEMICS IN NEPAL WITH LIMITED RESOURCES: OPTIMAL CONTROL THEORY APPROACH,"© 2022 Mathematics in Applied Sciences and Engineering. All rights reserved.In many developing countries, including Nepal, rabies epidemics constitute a serious public health concern, partly because of limited resources for proper implementation of control measures. In this study, we develop an extended model by incorporating various controls into the transmission dynamics model with both dog and jackal vectors. We apply the optimal control theory on the developed model system to identify optimal control strategy for mitigating rabies burden in Nepal with limited resources. Among the potential control strategies, human vaccination, dog vaccination, dog culling, dog sterilization, and jackal vaccination, considered in this study, our results show that a combination of dog vaccination and dog culling is the most effective strategy to control rabies in Nepal. Our optimal control solutions provide strategies for optimal implementation of these controls to suppress rabies prevalence in humans, dogs and jackals of Nepal using the minimum cost associated with controls. We found that given limited resources, implementing controls in a time-dependent manner with a higher level at the beginning of the outbreaks and reducing them during later part of the epidemics can provide maximum benefits.","['San Diego State University', 'Xavier University', 'Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College']",['United States'],"['Vaidya N.K.', 'Pantha B.', 'Joshi H.R.']","['dog and jackal vectors', 'mathematical model', 'optimal control theory', 'rabies in Nepal', 'resource limitation']",Mathematics in Applied Sciences and Engineering,Western University Libraries,"['Modeling and Simulation', 'Applied Mathematics']",['MATH'],Article,1,33.0,2022
EXAMINING HIV PROGRESSION MECHANISMS VIA MATHEMATICAL APPROACHES,"© 2022 Mathematics in Applied Sciences and Engineering. All rights reserved.The progression of HIV infection to AIDS is unclear and under-examined. Many mechanisms have been proposed, including a decline in immune response, increase in replication rate, involution of the thymus, syncytium inducing capacity, activation of the latently infected cell pool, chronic activation of the immune system, and the ability of the virus to infect other immune cells. The significance of each mechanism in combination has not been studied. We develop a simple HIV viral dynamics model incorporating proposed mechanisms as parameters that are allowed to vary. In the entire parameter space, we derive two formulae for the basic reproduction number (R0) by considering the infection starting with a single infected CD4 T cell and a single virion, respectively. We then show that both formulae are equivalent. Analytically, we derive conditions for the occurrence of backward and forward bifurcations. Numerically, we perform uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to identify model parameters that significantly affect disease progression, which include the infection rate, infected cell death and proliferation rates, and viral production and clearance rates. Focusing on these identified significant parameters, a series of numerical bifurcation analyses demonstrate various HIV/AIDS progression dynamics through one or two slowly changing parameters.","['York University', 'Texas Tech University']","['United States', 'Canada']","['Madras N.', 'Zhang W.', 'Heffernan J.M.', 'Bhagavath R.']","['bifurcation analysis', 'HIV progression', 'sensitivity analysis']",Mathematics in Applied Sciences and Engineering,Western University Libraries,"['Modeling and Simulation', 'Applied Mathematics']",['MATH'],Article,1,78.0,2022

Direct and Indirect Factors Affecting Teachers’ Burnout in the New Normal,"© 2020, University of San Jose-Recoletos. All rights reserved.The outbreak of the COVID-19 has brought about tiring tasks and unending demands in the Philippine educational system. With the abrupt shift of the teaching-learning process, teachers are pressured and stressed, which leads them to be burned out. The descriptive correlational research design determines the direct and indirect effects of perceived control to burnout through teachers’ personality traits of the 240 early childhood teachers. Data are analyzed using the Pearson r formula, Bivariate parametric correlation, and the Structural Equation Model (SEM). The study reveals that despite the challenges experienced in this time of pandemic, teachers have control over themselves and with the people around them. The teachers’ level of control does not influence their burnout; instead, their burnout is dependent on their emotional stability. Thus, burnout is a personal choice which is triggered by one’s emotion.

Thus, the article focuses on the consequences that this translation brought for the understanding of the ""system"" in the US theater, especially in the 20th century, and how the choices made by the editorial board and the translator were decisive during the transmission and the change of meaning of Stanislavski's text and, therefore, of his ideas.","['Universidade de São Paulo', 'Columbia University']","['Brazil', 'United States']","['Carnicke S.M.', 'Carvalho T.F.R.']","['Konstantin Stanislavski', 'Theater History', 'Translation']",Urdimento,State University of Santa Catarina,['Visual Arts and Performing Arts'],['ARTS'],Article,0,24.0,2021
THE UNDERSTANDING OF RULING AND MANAGEMENT OF LUQATAH (LOST PROPERTY) AMONG USIM STUDENTS,"© 2021, Faculty of Syariah and Law, Islamic Science University of Malaysia (USIM). All rights reserved.Luqatah (lost and found) is a property such as cash money, jewelleries, accessories, etc found in a place which is not owned by anyone, not guarded and the person who found it does not know the owner. Luqathah is one of the issues that are often found in daily life. This, most likely due to negligence on the side of the property’s owner. This study was conducted to find out the extent of understanding and awareness of USIM’s students on the concept of luqatah, especially when they find the dropped items and what they should do. This study used qualitative methods as well as quantitative one that aim to explain the object of study, based on direct observation, experience that aims to produce figures and measurable. The study found that hukum of returning dropped items in Islam is strongly recommended and required to take good care of them. Only 48.3 percent out of 118 respondents were knowledgeable about the meaning of luqatah. 44.1 percent out of 118 respondents will find out the owner of luqatah properties if they found them dropped. 74.6 percent out of 118 respondents were not well known how to manage the luqatah property.",['Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia'],['Malaysia'],"[""Mas'Ad Saleh M.A."", 'Sharif@Hamzah L.']","['Luqatah', 'Management', 'Property', 'Ruling', 'USIM']",Malaysian Journal of Syariah and Law,"Faculty of Syariah and Law, Islamic Science University of Malaysia (USIM)","['Law', 'Social Sciences (miscellaneous)', 'Religious Studies', 'Political Science and International Relations']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,33.0,2021
All Roads Lead to the Hague? The COVID-19 Pandemic and the No-harm Rule,"© 2021, Eotvos Lorand Tudomanyegyetem. All rights reserved.In this article, the author analyses the no-harm rule under customary international law in order to determine how the rule could be applied in the prevention of transboundary harm caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as in the possible adjudication of such harm. First, the author addresses whether the scope of the no-harm rule extends to transboundary harm caused by pandemics. Second, after examining the components of transboundary harm, the author will argue that the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant transboundary harm to most members of the international community. Third, the article will expand upon the obligation of states, under customary international law, to prevent significant transboundary harm. Finally, the author will provide some concluding remarks and address why the no-harm rule is an effective way of preventing as well as adjudicating transboundary harm caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.",['Papp és Társai CMS Cameron Mckenna Nabarro Olswang LLP Law Firm'],['Hungary'],['Bazso G.'],"['COVID-19', 'due diligence', 'no-harm rule', 'pandemics', 'state responsibility', 'transboundary harm']",ELTE Law Journal,Eotvos Lorand Tudomanyegyetem,['Law'],['SOCI'],Article,0,,2021
Justifiable Defence: A Comparison of Polish and Hungarian Solutions with an Outlook on the COVID-19 Pandemic,"© 2021, Eotvos Lorand Tudomanyegyetem. All rights reserved.The main question which this article seeks to answer is what justifies justifiable defence in substantive criminal law; what is the main reason for the existence of this exclusion of criminal liability? The focal notion of this paper is a presumption, according to which the justifications for the existence of justifiable defence are mostly self-preservation and natural law. We choose to compare the Polish and Hungarian solutions because of the historical and social similarities between Poland and Hungary (particularly in terms of the post-socialist characters of these countries) and the fact that, at least according to the present authors, the question of the justification of this legal institution was, arguably partially, resolved in Hungarian law. Finally, according to the COVID-19 pandemic that arose in 2020, we will observe in a separate chapter whether criminal liability would be excluded by justifiable defence in any cases of transmission of coronavirus.","['Eötvös Loránd Tudományegyetem', 'Uniwersytet Szczecinski']","['Poland', 'Hungary']","['Ambrus I.', 'Burdziak K.']","['comparative criminal law', 'coronavirus', 'justifiable defence', 'obstacles of criminal liability', 'pandemic']",ELTE Law Journal,Eotvos Lorand Tudomanyegyetem,['Law'],['SOCI'],Article,0,,2021
"The Role of Digitisation in Employment and Its New Challenges for Labour Law Regulation The Hungarian, Italian and Spanish Solutions, Comparison, and Criticism","© 2021, Eotvos Lorand Tudomanyegyetem. All rights reserved.The study comprehensively presents the main ef fects of digitisation. Due to its complexity, digitisation affects the employment and labour markets in different ways. It partially changes working conditions, brings to life new forms of employment and, as a result of the development of technology, professions disappear. Thus, all this necessarily poses different challenges to the legislation. The forms of work in the gig economy – which was brought to life by the online space – cannot be classified as a traditional legal framework. Teleworking has been absolutely valorised by the coronavirus pandemic. Looking to the near future, after the end of the pandemic, teleworking is expected to play a much more significant role in the labour market. The study presents the marked forms of digitisation that have emerged in employment and summarises its supranational legal issues. It also presents the digitisation characteristics of Hungary, Italy and Spain. It examines how legislation and the judiciary have provided answers to the issues of digitisation. Consequently, the study analyses three main trends: the impact of digitalisation in general, telework, and the gig economy, with special regard to the categorisation of workers (employees, self-employed and possible third categories in between). The study argues that the concept of ‘employment relationship’ has to be interpreted in a much broader way; general guarantees must be valid for all forms of work performed by people in economic dependence and in a state of economic weakness.","['Eötvös Loránd Tudományegyetem', 'Università degli Studi di Padova', 'Universidad Carlos III de Madrid']","['Italy', 'Hungary', 'Spain']","['Petrovics Z.', 'Del Prado D.P.', 'Horvath I.', 'Sitzia A.']","['application-based work', 'automation', 'classification of employment', 'crowdwork', 'digitisation', 'robotics', 'telework']",ELTE Law Journal,Eotvos Lorand Tudomanyegyetem,['Law'],['SOCI'],Article,0,,2021
The Response to the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Contracts for the Carriage of Passengers by Air and Package Travel in the German and Italian Law Systems,"© 2021, Eotvos Lorand Tudomanyegyetem. All rights reserved.This article investigates the response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on contracts for the carriage of passengers by air and package travel in the German and Italian law systems, by presenting the relevant rules of positive law and their application by German and Italian courts. In fact, the courts of the two Member States have rendered several decisions on the cancellation of flights by carriers and the withdrawal from package travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the issuance of vouchers following the termination of the related contracts. What emerges from this article is that, unlike the German law system, the Italian one has adopted a response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic which is not fully consistent with the indications coming from the EU level. In particular, an element of disruption with respect to the relevant EU guidelines is the adoption by the Italian legislature of art 88-bis D-L 18/2020, which addresses (residual) cases of so-called mandatory vouchers.",['Università degli Studi di Torino'],['Italy'],['Piovesani E.'],"['contract', 'COVID-19', 'flight cancellation', 'overriding mandatory provision', 'package travel', 'passenger rights', 'voucher']",ELTE Law Journal,Eotvos Lorand Tudomanyegyetem,['Law'],['SOCI'],Article,0,,2021
Police Brutality and Human Rights Violations in the COVID-19 Era through the Lens of Selected African Countries,"© 2021, Eotvos Lorand Tudomanyegyetem. All rights reserved.Global responses to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic since its discovery in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 have been geared towards containing the virus through the adoption of measures such as restrictions on movement and social distancing to reduce physical contact among persons. Countries have also adopted diverse legislation, regulation and policies; and have also exercised emergency powers to facilitate restrictive measures. Various international instruments emphasise the need for restrictive measures to be objective without any attendant violation of individual human rights to dignity and other freedoms. Utilising a mixed methods approach, involving doctrinal, historical, critical and geopolitical perspectives, this paper examines the acts of law enforcement officers in implementing compliance with various COVID-19 measures and their effect on the fundamental rights of citizens in selected African countries. It discusses the trend of human rights violations in these countries and analyses the legality of adopted enforcement measures in line with international human rights law.","['Nigerian Institute of Advanced Legal Studies', 'University of Lagos']",['Nigeria'],"['Eruaga O.A.', 'Okukpon I.']","['COVID-19', 'human rights', 'lockdown', 'police brutality', 'restrictions']",ELTE Law Journal,Eotvos Lorand Tudomanyegyetem,['Law'],['SOCI'],Article,1,,2021
"Knowledge, perception and preventive practices of COVID-19 among Primary Health Care workers in Ogun State, Nigeria","© BUMJ.Objective: This study was carried out to determine the COVID-19 knowledge, perception, and preventive practices among primary health care workers in Ogun state. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out among 339 primary health care workers in Ogun state using self-administered questionnaires. Knowledge of COVID-19 was graded as good with a minimum score of 75% while perception was graded as good with a score greater than the mean scores. Preventive practices were categorized as good with minimum scores of 75%. Associations between knowledge, practice, and categorical variables were assessed using the chi-square test with the level of significance set at p < 0.05 Results: The mean age of respondents was 42.30 ± 8.73 years. The major source of information on COVID-19 was health training (99.7%). A total of 50.7% had good knowledge of COVID-19 while 42.8% had a good perception of COVID-19. The majority (92.9%) had good COVID-19 preventive practices. Length of years in service was significantly associated (p=0.024) with knowledge of COVID-19. Conclusion: About half of the health care workers had good knowledge of COVID-19 while the perception of COVID-19 was poor. However, preventive practices carried out among the healthcare workers were good. Efforts should be made to further improve the knowledge and perception of primary health care workers as they play a vital role in the delivery of health care services in the state.",['Olabisi Onabanjo University'],['Nigeria'],"['Adeyemi O.', 'Daniel O.', 'Ojo A.', 'Bamidele J.', 'Gbadebo A.']","['COVID-19', 'health care workers', 'knowledge', 'perception', 'preventive practices']",Babcock University Medical Journal,Babcock Medical Society,['Medicine (all)'],['MEDI'],Article,0,16.0,2020
Prevalence of Obesity and its primary comorbidities among patients attending the dietetics out-patient clinic in a tertiary health institution in southwestern Nigeria,"© BUMJ. 2020 O.Objective: The study assessed the prevalence of obesity and its co-morbidities among patients attending the dietetics outpatient clinic of the hospital. Methods: The prevalence of obesity and its co-morbidities were assessed in this retrospective study from the available in the outpatient clinic of the Dietetics Department in University College Hospital Ibadan, Oyo State. Age, gender, occupation, religion, height, weight, diagnosed diseases were extracted from the record of individuals who presented at the clinic over 72 months. Data obtained was analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20. Result: A total of 3248 patients’ records were assessed. Of these, 1174 (36.15%) patients met the criteria for obesity according to their recorded BMI; 614(52.3%) had obesity class I (BMI 30–34.9), 343(29.2%) had obesity class II (BMI 35–39.9) and 217(18.5%) had obesity class III (BMI ≥40). Obesity was significantly higher amongst females than males (p<0.05). The most prevalent single co-morbidity was diabetes 22.3%, while the most prevalent double co-morbidity was hypertension/diabetes 22.9%. Conclusion: The prevalence of obesity amongst patients was significant. Diabetes and hypertension were the most dominant co-morbidity. Interventions should be developed to combat the increasing prevalence of the diseases and these should involve educating the public and clinical management of the diseases upon identification.","['Babcock University', 'University College Hospital, Ibadan']",['Nigeria'],"['Alfa T.', 'Abdulsalam A.O.', 'Adetola A.B.', 'Olatunji O.', 'Oduneye T.M.']","['Body mass index', 'comorbidities', 'Diabetes', 'Obesity']",Babcock University Medical Journal,Babcock Medical Society,['Medicine (all)'],['MEDI'],Article,0,22.0,2020
Leiomyoma of the anterior vaginal wall: a rare case,"© BUMJ.Background: Leiomyoma is a benign smooth muscle mesenchymal tumor, usually of uterine origin but may rarely develop in the vaginal walls. Case presentation: A case of 40-year-old para 5+0 woman with anterior vaginal wall leiomyoma is reported. The presentation mimics that of uterovaginal prolapse and hence presents a diagnostic challenge. The unusual appearance of the protrusion, failure to reduce at any time even while lying down, and complete absence of urinary symptoms raised the suspicion of a rare case. The diagnosis was made through examination under anesthesia, cystoscopy, and biopsy. Histological examination of the biopsy specimen confirmed vaginal wall leiomyoma. The patient had complete excision of the mass without any complications. Discussion and Conclusion: Vaginal wall leiomyoma is a rare benign vaginal lesion that can easily be misdiagnosed. Diagnosis involves critical clinical evaluation, especially during pelvic examinations. Any vaginal protrusion should be approached with a high index of suspicion, especially in patients of reproductive age.","['Federal Medical Centre Nigeria', 'University of Ilorin']",['Nigeria'],"['Popoola A.', 'Ezeoke G.G.', 'Abdul I.F.', 'Balogun O.R.', 'Jimoh O.S.', 'Adeniran A.S.']","['Biopsy', 'Cystoscopy', 'Leiomyoma', 'Utero-Vaginal Prolapse', 'Vaginal Wall']",Babcock University Medical Journal,Babcock Medical Society,['Medicine (all)'],['MEDI'],Article,0,12.0,2020

Methods: A quasi-experimental study was conducted among 60 waste-pickers recruited by multistage sampling technique divided into intervention and control group. There was a baseline assessment of waste-handling practices in both intervention and control groups using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. Thereafter, health-risk reduction training was given using lectures, and demonstrations. Three months after the intervention, another assessment of the same waste-pickers was conducted with the same instrument. Waste-handling practices and knowledge responses were measured on a 54-point rating scale and 17-point rating scale respectively. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 23 to generate descriptive and inferential. Results: At baseline, the waste-pickers in the control group had a mean waste-handling score of 17.80±6.89 while the experimental group had a mean of (17.97±5.47). After the training program, there was a statistically significant increase in the mean waste-handling score of the experimental group (47.30±3.28; p= 0.000) while there was no increase in the mean waste-handling score of the control group (17.80±6.89). This significant increase in the mean waste-handling score of the experimental group (53.83±0.38; p=0.000) was also observed at 3 month follow-up period.

A Reassessment of Wolfgang Sichardt’s 1936 Field Recordings of Swiss Yodel,"© Trabzon University State Conservatory.Historical field recordings offer insight both into past performance routines and into the processes and contexts of musical practices in their time. In the wake of renewed interest in musical traditions of the alpine region, I reassessed the magnetic tape recordings created by the Jena University doctoral student Wolfgang Sichardt (1911–2002) from multiple perspectives. The premises and context of the field research in 1936 are reconstructed, in part based on original correspondence; the reception and impact of the research in Germany and Switzerland are assessed; and the exact origin of the recordings is determined wherever possible. Descriptive transcriptions of the entire corpus of yodel and alphorn music visualize the content. The 1936 field recordings, made by Sichardt during a six-week field trip to different areas of Switzerland, document yodels, folk songs, and alphorn melodies on 12 magnetic tape reels, recorded with the latest technology at the time, the AEG Magnetophon K-2.

"Client Satisfaction: Understanding its Predictors to improve HIV treatment and care in a tertiary facility southwestern state, Nigeria","© BUMJ.Objective: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection is a major public health concern. Frequent hospital visits are needed on the part of the patient to achieve decreased prevalence, the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and viral suppression. Patient satisfaction is needed to achieve the aforementioned outcomes of care. This study, therefore, was conducted to assess clients’ satisfaction and perception of the quality of HIV/AIDs services and to elicit factors associated with dissatisfaction. Method: A cross-sectional survey was done using a systematic sampling method to select the study population. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, chi-square test, and logistic regression at a p-value set at < 0.05. Results: Most of the respondents (34.4%) were within the age range of 36-44years. The mean age was 42.1± 11.5years. The overall satisfaction was 85.6%. The majority of respondents (95.2%) affirmed that the quality of care received was good. Unavailability of HIV educational materials was shown to predict clients’ satisfaction more than other factors with 3.545; 95% CI: 1.519-8.275; p = 0.003. Likewise, clients who perceived health workers to be non-accepting and judgmental are 3.6 times more likely to be unsatisfied with HIV services provided compared to those who do not (3. 580; 95% CI: 1.264-10.141; p = 0.016).

Sound Ethnobiology of Musical Instruments: A Sound View of Nature in Manufacturing Kemençe,"© 2017-2021, Trabzon University State Conservatory.Kemençe (small three-stringed fiddle) is mostly performed in the Eastern Black Sea region of Turkey. In this study, we examine the manufacturing process of kemençe considering its relationship with natural sources. Data about the production and performance of kemençe are collected by fieldwork since 2018. In this context, the first author took kemençe courses from Ilyas Parlak, a well-known kemençe player, to understand the performance of the instrument in the region. He also held interviews with the luthiers to understand the usage of the biological and non-biological materials in the making process of this instrument. In this study, we propose the term sound ethnobiology to reveal how instruments are associated with nature in relation to their manufacture and performance. We have considered the term sound ethnobiology of musical instruments into five categories which are interrelated to each other. These categories are ‘bioecological sources of sound production’, ‘ecological knowledge of sound production’, ‘timbre arrangement of producing proper sound’, ‘traditional ecological knowledge of the sound of musical instruments’, and ‘ecological meanings of musical instruments’. We have put forward the manufacturing process and performances of the kemençe and its relationship to the nature in and around Trabzon by considering these five categories. Thus, we revealed that the kemençe making process is strongly tied to the interpretation of the natural sources in the region. This interpretation of the usage of the natural sources creates the traditional ecological knowledge of kemençe which is also strongly connected to its ecological meaning and the nature of the Eastern Black Sea region.","['Trabzon University', 'İstanbul Teknik Üniversitesi']",['Turkey'],"['Karahasanoglu S.', 'Aslan U.']","['Kemençe', 'Sound ecology', 'Sound ethnobiology', 'Traditional ecological knowledge']",Musicologist,Trabzon University State Conservatory,['Music'],['ARTS'],Article,0,52.0,2017

"Turkish Disco: The Intersection of Anatolian Pop, Groove, and Psychedelia","Trabzon University State Conservatory © 2017-2021.This article aims to examine the genre of Turkish disco, with its local and global connotations. Using the theory of glocalization, the genre will be discussed as a means to understand current dynamics in the music industry. This research is a product of a discography survey and fieldwork consisting of extended interviews with DJs and musicians who were a part of the scene. What is labeled as disco music in Turkey, and what is referred to as 'Turkish disco' in the global music industry are, in fact, two different music cultures. The term's local usage refers to specific Turkish recordings from the late 1970s, in which various forms of Turkish art and folk music were reinterpreted, usually with Moog synthesizers. On the other hand, more recent connotations of Turkish disco owe much to DJs, and the digging, editing, and remixing culture of the 2010s. Coming hand in hand with the term Turkish psychedelic, many of these recent edits and remixes by DJs and producers were selected from the LPs and singles of the 1970s, which drew inspiration from pop, soul, folk, jazz, psychedelic rock, funk, and Anatolian pop. Thus, Turkish disco in the past decade has become an umbrella term for contemporary edits and remixes of the Turkish popular music of the 1970s. The reinterpretation of the forms such as Oyun Havası and potpori within the subheading of disco will be analyzed to understand the cultural aesthetics of taste and the political background of musical fusion.",['Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin'],['Germany'],['Uyar Y.M.'],"['Anatolian pop', 'Disco', 'Fusion', 'Glocalization', 'Popular music', 'Turkish disco', 'Turkish psychedelic']",Musicologist,Trabzon University State Conservatory,['Music'],['ARTS'],Article,0,53.0,2017
Svan Funeral Dirges (Zär): Cultural Context,"Trabzon University State Conservatory © 2017-2021.This article is a companion paper to Scherbaum and Mzhavanadze (2020), Mzhavanadze and Scherbaum (2020) and Scherbaum and Mzhavanadze (2021). Together they describe the results of an interdisciplinary study of the three-part funeral dirge of Svan zär (‘zari’ in Georgian). In the present paper, we provide all the contextual (ethnographic, ethnological, historical) data that we collected from various written and/or oral sources and then processed and organized in a comprehensible way to help the reader better understand this unique phenomenon. We believe that in order to help answer the basic question of ‘how zärs work,’ the results of the acoustical, musicological, and phonetic (as well as language-music interface) analyses in the other three articles must be interpreted through an understanding of the full context of this unique cultural behavior. Thus, not only did we collect and integrate all the related data and review the literature, but we also raise and discuss some problematic issues, such as, for example, the etymology of the term zär. We also offer an interpretation/description of some conflicting historical data to generate interest for its further research. In addition, we introduce the reader to some details of our field research (2015, 2016), as they may be of great importance when discussing or interpreting the results of the analyses presented in other (analytical) parts of this interdisciplinary study.",['Universität Potsdam'],['Germany'],"['Mzhavanadze N.', 'Scherbaum F.']","['Funerary ritual', 'Multipart dirge', 'Traditional Georgian vocal music']",Musicologist,Trabzon University State Conservatory,['Music'],['ARTS'],Article,1,78.0,2017
LEGAL ANALYSIS OF FORCED LABOUR IN THE CONTEXT OF INTERNATIONAL LABOUR STANDARD AND THE MALAYSIAN LAW ANALISA PERUNDANGAN BURUH PAKSA DALAM KONTEKS PIAWAIAN PERBURUHAN ANTARABANGSA DAN UNDANG-UNDANG MALAYSIA,"© 2021, Faculty of Syariah and Law, Islamic Science University of Malaysia (USIM). All rights reserved.The issue of labour exploitation has been given media coverage at local and international level. It is one form of human trafficking which has been condemned by the international community. As a member of the International Labor Organization (ILO), this issue needs to be taken seriously. This study aims to examine the international labour standard and the Malaysian law relating to forced labor and trafficking in person by analysing the related legal framework using a doctrinal methodology and library based research as well as analysis of selected decided cases. Although Malaysia has local laws such as the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Act 2007 (ATIPSOM) [Act 670] which covers aspects of exploitation and coercion, as well as Employment Act 1955 [Act 265]and Workers' Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities Act, 1990 [Act 446), there are allegations that there are lacuna in these laws which need to be improved in order to address the issue of labour exploitation or forced labor practices in Malaysia successfully. It may be concluded that since the terms of forced labor are not defined in any law in Malaysia it causes ambiguity and difficulties in the application and enforcement of law. Thus, it is very important to carefully understand the intended meaning of a term in the legislation to ensure the extent of labour exploitation or forced labor practice in the Malaysian context.","['Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia', 'Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia']",['Malaysia'],"['Hassan K.H.', 'Shah H.R.', 'Muhamad@Ahmad H.B.']","['ATIPSOM', 'Forced Labour', 'Labour Exploitation', 'Labour Rights']",Malaysian Journal of Syariah and Law,"Faculty of Syariah and Law, Islamic Science University of Malaysia (USIM)","['Law', 'Social Sciences (miscellaneous)', 'Religious Studies', 'Political Science and International Relations']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,32.0,2021
PROTOCOLS AND FATWA IN MALAYSIA ON WITHHOLDING AND WITHDRAWAL OF LIFE-SUSTAINING TREATMENT IN INTENSIVE CARE UNITS: AN OVERVIEW,"© 2021, Faculty of Syariah and Law, Islamic Science University of Malaysia (USIM). All rights reserved.For many Muslim patients, families and intensive care physicians, deciding on whether to withhold or withdraw life support remains challenging. This point of transition from active intervention to the palliation process requires a crucial decision-making process. The decision involves conveying information to families to be well prepared beforehand, especially during the process of withdrawing life-sustaining treatment. Once the final decision to withdraw life sustainment has been made, procedure on cessation of care, treatment withdrawal and nature of follow-up support will be informed to the family members. This is especially so considering that the relationship between Islamic ethico-legal guidance and clinical protocols on such matters remains scattered and difficult to interpret. In light of this gap, we conducted a short review to aggregate clinical protocols and rulings from Islamic fatwas on whether, and when, it is permitted to withdraw and/or withhold life-sustaining care. This article aims to explore relationship regarding decision in withholding and withdrawing life-sustaining treatment, based on guidelines by Malaysian intensive care unit protocol and the fatwa in Malaysia. The methodology chosen for this study is content analysis of the relevant published literatures. We found the decision for withholding and withdrawing life sustaining treatment in intensive care unit are correlated between the ICU protocol and fatwa in Malaysia. In addressing the withholding and withdrawal of life-sustaining measures, the Muslim health-care workers as well as families should take a more cohesive approach, as this is parallel to the fatwa in Islam.","['Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia', 'School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia']",['Malaysia'],"['Hehsan M.R.', 'Shukeri W.F.W.M.']","['fatwa', 'Malaysia', 'protocol', 'withdrawal', 'withholding']",Malaysian Journal of Syariah and Law,"Faculty of Syariah and Law, Islamic Science University of Malaysia (USIM)","['Law', 'Social Sciences (miscellaneous)', 'Religious Studies', 'Political Science and International Relations']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,33.0,2021
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ḤAḌĀNAH IN MALAYSIAN SHARĪ ̒AH COURT: A LITERATURE REVIEW IMPLEMENTASI ḤAḌĀNAH DI MAHKAMAH SYARIAH MALAYSIA: SOROTAN LITERATUR,"© 2021, Faculty of Syariah and Law, Islamic Science University of Malaysia (USIM). All rights reserved.Ḥaḍānah or child custody is an issue that often arises after divorce until today. Various initiatives are carried out by the authorities such as the Syariah High Court, the Syariah Judiciary Department of Malaysia (JKSM) and the Islamic Religious Council for each state in Malaysia to overcome this problem. This is because, this issue involves the welfare of Muslim children, that are affected by divorce as well as the rights of disputing parties, namely mother and father that need to be emphasized. Therefore, this literature review is to identify the issues that arise, the development and solutions provided for haḍānah issues. This study is qualitative by taking a descriptive content analysis approach by evaluating facts and arguments from various primary and secondary sources related to the study. To support the findings of the study, syariah court judge was also interviewed. The results of literature review shows that several issues are arising in the Syariah Court such as the existence of International Convention affecting Islamic Family Law, the limitation of sole custody practice, the absence of specific interpretations for the welfare of Muslim children, the issue of determining children`s religion in ḥaḍānah, the issue of ḥaḍānah is assumed biased towards women. This study also identifies positive developments in the resolution of ḥaḍānah cases in terms of its application, namely the interpretation of the welfare of the children in ḥaḍānah is clarified, the proposal of the concept of maṣlaḥah as a measure of children's welfare, granting joint custody to parents, sulh function in ḥaḍānah, proposed establishment of the Family Court in Malaysia and involvement of experts in related disciplines. However, in general, there are some of these suggestions that have not been implemented and are still at the evaluation stage. Therefore, this study suggests that these aspects need to be discovered and specific guidelines need to be formed and harmonized based on the principles of haḍānah welfare to achieve Maqāṣid Al-Sharī ̒ah which also is in accordance with the demands of the times and social changes in Malaysia.",['International Islamic University Malaysia'],['Malaysia'],"['Zin N.M.', 'Sitiris M.', 'Nasir N.M.']","['Child Custody', 'Haḍānah', 'Islamic Family Law', 'Shariah High Court']",Malaysian Journal of Syariah and Law,"Faculty of Syariah and Law, Islamic Science University of Malaysia (USIM)","['Law', 'Social Sciences (miscellaneous)', 'Religious Studies', 'Political Science and International Relations']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,37.0,2021
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF INTENT ON ZAKATABLE REAL ESTATE: A JURISTIC ANALYSIS,"© 2021, Faculty of Syariah and Law, Islamic Science University of Malaysia (USIM). All rights reserved.Real estate remains one of the most significant properties for personal use and investment purposes. Individual institutions and corporate bodies operate on real estate properties. In recent times, there have been several concerns among zakatable individuals and organizations on the shariah criteria for identifying zakatable real estate properties because of the difference between assets for personal use and commercial purposes. There is 'arūd tijārah (commodities for sale) such as real estate, land, car, and goods in real estate investment. On the other hand, 'arūd quniyyah, (durable properties) are intended for personal use such as a private house, private car, private vacation home. This study aims to conceptually analyze the concept of intention in Islam and its juristic interpretations to distinguish between zakatable and non-zakatable real estate properties. This study relies on the inductive approach in gathering and arranging data from classical and modern literature. It also uses the descriptive method in explaining the basic terms in the research. The study found that real estate owners' intent influences the asset's zakat status. First, 'arūd quniyyah (real estate) are durable assets, meant for personal use, are Zakat free, while the real 'arūd tijārah (estate commercial assets) are subject to Zakat. The commercial assets can also be for sale and rental. The study finally suggests that zakat calculations of zakatable real estate should be subjected to supervision and validation of competent contemporary Shariah scholars to ascertain juristic position on the distinctions between zakatable and non-zakatable assets.","['International Islamic University Malaysia', 'Federal University, Kashere']","['Nigeria', 'Malaysia']","['Sitris M.', 'Zakariyah L.', 'Busari S.A.']","['Intention', 'Real Estate', 'Zakat', 'ʽArūd Quniyyah', 'ʽArūd Tijārah']",Malaysian Journal of Syariah and Law,"Faculty of Syariah and Law, Islamic Science University of Malaysia (USIM)","['Law', 'Social Sciences (miscellaneous)', 'Religious Studies', 'Political Science and International Relations']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,33.0,2021

Criminal acts are not only being committed by adults, but even children are also capable of committing various types of crimes involving murder, theft, violation of human dignity, and injuries. The phenomenon of crimes committed by children are becoming more alarming by days. These criminal acts by children require a very rigid handling from various parties and authorities. In Islamic Law, there are discussions about the sentences for the underage criminals. This article discusses three types of crimes committed by underage, namely crimes related to human life, crimes that cause loss of property, and crimes related of human dignity.

THE EVOLUTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BETWEEN MALAYSIA AND NORTH KOREA,"© 2021, Faculty of Syariah and Law, Islamic Science University of Malaysia (USIM). All rights reserved.This paper aims to analyse the aftermath of Kim Jong Nam’s assassination on the diplomatic relations between Malaysia and North Korea along with the historical evolution of diplomatic relations between both countries since Malaysia’s independence. Little is known about the nature of diplomatic relations between Malaysia and North Korea, especially when public perceptions dictate that both countries barely share any similarities. In appreciating the implications of the murder case from the perspective of international law, an analysis is carried out on the history of diplomatic relations between Putrajaya and Pyongyang. A further study is conducted on the factors which attract Malaysia and North Korea to forge and strengthen their diplomatic relations. Malaysia’s inclusive foreign policy is highlighted via her participation in the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) in 1970 which promotes peaceful engagement with all countries regardless of their political allegiance, including the Communist-led regime in North Korea. The task of preserving regional safety and bolstering economic prosperity are top on Putrajaya’s priority list. With the volume of bilateral trade between Malaysia and North Korea is steadily increasing and Pyongyang’s continuous provocations of her Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), peaceful engagements with the aim of repairing the damaged diplomatic relations is the best option for both countries. This study concludes that although the relationship between the two nations are severed, it is crucial for Malaysia to consider reviving and enhancing bilateral relations with North Korea, hence benefiting Putrajaya in outlining Malaysia’s future foreign policy.",['Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia'],['Malaysia'],['Talib M.R.B.'],"['geopolitics', 'international law', 'international relations', 'malaysia-north korea diplomatic relations', 'non-alignment', 'tracks of diplomacy']",Malaysian Journal of Syariah and Law,"Faculty of Syariah and Law, Islamic Science University of Malaysia (USIM)","['Law', 'Social Sciences (miscellaneous)', 'Religious Studies', 'Political Science and International Relations']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,187.0,2021

All rights reserved.Muslim wife has a legal right of maintenance which devolves upon her husband. This rights exclusively created by the marriage and wife is entitled to maintenance during the subsistence of the marriage and after divorce for iddat period under the Islamic Shariah and Muslim personal law in Bangladesh. Usually, the Muslim women enforces the claim for her maintenance while obtaining divorce. Divorce brings distress in her life and it also creates jeopardized situation in the society. In doing so, the controversy arises regarding the post-divorce maintenance beyond iddat period of Muslim women under Islamic Shariah. Though the judiciary of many countries are trying to reform on the post-divorce maintenance, but judicial activism of the country has not much advancement in this issue. Hence, the divorced Muslim women are not entitled post-divorce maintenance beyond iddat period in the country. In addition, often women are not getting access to family justice rather they suffered adversely for difficulties of legal procedure, male oriented society and non-implementation of Islamic values. Therefore, majority divorced woman faces many challenges of social justice and not being protected in the present legal system. The objective of the study is how and to what extent Muslim wives are being protected through maintenance under the Islamic Shariah as well as the Muslim personal law in Bangladesh. So, qualitative research method is used in this study and the primary information is collected from the Holy Quran, Sunnah and as well as different journal articles, books, reported cases and websites.

"REFUGEES IN MALAYSIA: PROTECTION FRAMEWORK, CHALLENGES, AND IMPLICATIONS","© 2021, Faculty of Syariah and Law, Islamic Science University of Malaysia (USIM). All rights reserved.The arrivals and protracted presence of asylum seekers and refugees in Malaysia have been met with policies largely shaped by humanitarian approaches leading to inconsistent responses and an impasse in achieving durable solutions to refugee dilemmas. This qualitative study using the method of desk review of materials such as books, journals, and newspaper articles identifies the human rights protection framework for asylum seekers and refugees and the problematic implications and challenges for both refugees and the host country, Malaysia, due to the absence of a formal refugee protection framework at the national level. Despite gaps in and outdated nature of the 1951 Refugee Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, it calls for refugee legal protections to be based on a legal and governance framework rather than non-binding aspirations and ad hoc approaches. The latter has proved adverse to both the interests of the host state and refugee communities. The findings indicate that the impacts on denial and violation of the rights and protections of refugees across political, social, and economic terrains are accompanied by risks to Malaysia’s public security and interests. The study concludes with several early recommendations on the need to firstly recognise the legal status of refugees in Malaysia and the urgency to design an adequate protection and governance framework complemented with a system of shared responsibility to protect and manage refugees who have been in protracted limbo for an average of 20 years, if not more, without durable solutions to their plight.",['Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia'],['Malaysia'],"['Mamat Z.', 'Razali R.M.', 'Ismail W.A.F.W.', 'Hamzah S.A.', 'Zulkifli A.A.', 'Rahmatullah T.']","['1951 Refugee Convention', 'durable solutions', 'Malaysia', 'protection framework', 'Refugees', 'UNHCR']",Malaysian Journal of Syariah and Law,"Faculty of Syariah and Law, Islamic Science University of Malaysia (USIM)","['Law', 'Social Sciences (miscellaneous)', 'Religious Studies', 'Political Science and International Relations']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,79.0,2021

TF was characterized by using FT-IR, thermal analysis and zeta potential measurements. The biosorption of MV was significantly dependent on the pH of the solutions and the highest removal for MV was observed at pH=9.0 which was also proved with zeta potential measurement. Biosorption equilibrium was established in 10 min and a definition of the overall ratecontrolling step in the biosorption of MV onto TF was carried out. The biosorption data were in good agreement with the pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir isotherm models. The maximum biosorption capacity of TF for MV was determined as 1180.09 mg g−1.

Optimization Based Undersampling for Imbalanced Classes Dengesiz Sınıflamada Optimizasyona Dayalı Azörnekleme,"© 2021, Adiyaman University. All rights reserved.The classification methods consider the probability of predicting the majority class to be high when the number of class observations is different. To address this problem, there are some methods such as resampling methods in the literature. Undersampling, one of the resampling methods, creates balance by removing data from the majority class. This study aims to compare different optimization methods to determine the most suitable observations to be taken from the majority class while undersampling. Firstly, a simple simulation study was conducted and graphs were used to analyze the discrepancy between the resampled datasets. Then, different classifier models were constructed for different imbalanced data sets. In these models, random undersampling, undersampling with genetic algorithm, undersampling with differential evolution algorithm, undersampling with an artificial bee colony, and under-sampling with particle herd optimization were compared. The results were given rank numbers differing depending on the classifiers and data sets and a general mean rank was obtained.

Density Functional Theory Studies of Some Barbiturates on Lipophilicity Bazı Barbitüratların Lipofilikliği Üzerine Yoğunluk Fonksiyonel Teori Çalışmaları,"© 2021, Adiyaman University. All rights reserved.This paper deals with the evaluation of lipophilicity expressed by logPow parameter of ten barbiturate derivatives generally used as sedative-hypnotics based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. All geometry optimizations and frequency calculations have been carried out by using DFT/B3LYP/ 6-311++G (d,p) basis set in gas phase and also in water and n-octanol phases. Gibbs free energies of solvation for studied barbiturates were calculated to predict logPow. The correlation between the calculated logPow values and available data in literature has been examined. Root mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), mean absolute deviation (MAD) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) statistics were utilized in measuring predictive accuracy (forecast performance) of DFT method used in this study. Accordingly, the reasonable results have been obtained in estimating the partition coefficient of the mentioned ten barbiturate derivatives by DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G (d,p) method. The lipophilicity tendency of the studied barbiturates was interpreted with the help of the calculated quantum chemical descriptors such as HOMO energy (EHOMO), LUMO energy (ELUMO), molecular volume (Vm), electrophilicity index (ω). ELUMO, Vm, and ω descriptors gave reasonable results rather than EHOMO. Also, the 3D molecular lipophilicity potential (MLP) maps that display the accumulative lipophilic contributions of each atom in studied barbiturates were visualized.",['Inönü Üniversitesi'],['Turkey'],"['Bayri A.', 'Serin S.']","['Barbiturate', 'DFT', 'Error analysis', 'Solvation free energy']",Adiyaman University Journal of Science,Adiyaman University,"['Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics', 'Nuclear and High Energy Physics', 'Condensed Matter Physics', 'Applied Mathematics']","['MATH', 'PHYS']",Article,0,52.0,2021
Identification of Damaging SNPs and Their Effects on Alzheimer’s Disease Associated PSEN1 Protein: Computational Analysis Zarar Verici SNP’lerin ve Alzheimer Hastalığıyla İlişkili PSEN1 Proteinine Etkilerinin Tanımlanması: Hesaplamalı Analiz,"© 2021, Adiyaman University. All rights reserved.Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and pathologically characterized by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles (tau aggregation) and amyloid plaques (amyloid-beta (A!) aggregation). PSEN1 protein with 9 transmembrane helices acts as aspartyl protease and is one of the catalytic components of γ secretase complex, that cleaves amyloid precursor protein (APP). Furthermore, PSEN1 protein plays a significant role in the process of APP and in the generation of amyloid beta (Aβ). In the present study, it was aimed to estimate the probable deleterious effects of missense SNPs in PSEN1 gene that is associated with AD on protein stability and structure by using bioinformatics tools. SIFT, PolyPhen-2, PROVEAN, PhD SNP, and PANTHER PSEP software were used to estimate the deleterious SNPs, whereas I Mutant 3.0 and MUpro web tools were used to determine the effects of amino acid substitution on protein stability. Additionally, the effects of wild type and mutant amino acids on protein threedimensional structure via modeling were predicted by Project HOPE webserver. The phylogenetic conservation of amino acid residues of PSEN1 protein was analyzed by ConSurf. In total, 386 missense SNPs were found in the human PSEN1 gene from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (NCBI dbSNP) database and 65 SNPs of which were determined to be deleterious or damaging. In the present study, 8 significant missense SNPsrs63749891 (R278T), rs63750301 (P264L), rs63750353 (N135D), rs63750524 (R278S), rs63750772 (E273A), rs63751229 (P267S), rs121917807 (G266S), and rs201617677 (R157S) were determined as high-risk pathogenic. Some differences between wild-type amino acids and mutant amino acids such as hydrophobicity, charge, size, and folding properties were determined according to the modeling findings. Our study demonstrates that high-risk pathogenic missense SNPs have the potential to alter the catalytic activity of the γ secretase complex and subsequently the amount of Aβ40 and Aβ42. Therefore, these missense SNPs may contribute to AD pathogenesis studies.",['Hitit University'],['Turkey'],['Avsar O.'],"['Alzheimer’s Disease', 'Gene', 'Mutation', 'PSEN1', 'SNP']",Adiyaman University Journal of Science,Adiyaman University,"['Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics', 'Nuclear and High Energy Physics', 'Condensed Matter Physics', 'Applied Mathematics']","['MATH', 'PHYS']",Article,0,32.0,2021

All rights reserved.Ambystoma mexicanum belongs to the family Ambystomatidae. It is one of the 30 species of the genus Ambystoma, which lives in a wide geography from southern Mexico to southern Alaska. It is accepted as a model organism in evolutionary biology, developmental biology, and regenerative medicine research. It can regenerate the brain, heart, and kidney organs as well as limb regeneration. Accurate identification of the model organism is important for the reproducibility and comparability of experiments. We aimed to confirm the species identification of axolotls using integrated taxonomic methods that were grown at Mersin University Aquaculture Units of the Faculty of Fisheries. Cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) and cytochrome b (Cytb) gene fragments of mtDNA sequences were used as molecular markers for phylogenetic analyses and species delimitation methods and compared with the sequences that were submitted to NCBI GenBank as species of Ambystoma. In the analyses that were conducted with different data sets, the individuals in question were grouped as a candidate species with the A. mexicanum species whose sequences were given in previous studies. All sequences obtained in this study and A. mexicanum sequences obtained from NCBI GenBank were grouped as haplotypes and their genetic distances were found to be 0 and it was determined that the individuals which were the subject of this study definitely belong to the A. mexicanum species. The results revealed that some species within the genus Ambystoma, especially A. barbouri and A. texanum, may be species complexes. On the other hand, A. mexicanum was grouped together with A. andersoni as candidate species in all analyses performed with the combined datasets of COI, Cytb, and COI+Cytb.

All rights reserved.Lake Van fish is one of few vertebrate species living in the lake, therefore it plays a very useful role as an indicator in determining lake pollution. Deltamethrin (DLT) is one of the pesticides used extensively in the Lake Van basin. In this study, it was aimed to determine the effects of DLT on the primary gill cell culture. Different concentrations of DLT (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 μM) were added to primary gill cell culture and the total antioxidant and oxidant levels, malondialdehyde (MDA), and 8- hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels were determined at the end of 24 and 48 h of administration. While the highest concentration of applied DLT (10 μM) caused a significant increase in the total oxidant level at 48 h, a decrease in the total antioxidant level was detected at 24 and 48 h (P < 0.05). The increase in MDA level, which is the product of lipid peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acids, with DLT concentrations of 1–10 μM at the end of 24 and 48 h was found to be significant (P < 0.05). As a result, it can be said that DLT caused oxidative stress in the primary gill cell culture of Lake Van fish exposed to concentrations of 1 and 10 μM, but no genotoxic effect was observed.",['Van Yüzüncü Yıl Üniversitesi'],['Turkey'],['Kaval Oguz E.'],"['DNA damage', 'Lake Van', 'Lipid peroxidation', 'Oxidative stress', 'Pesticide']",Commagene Journal of Biology,ABADER (Adıyaman Bilimsel Arastırmalar Dernegi),"['Biochemistry', 'Physiology', 'Microbiology', 'Molecular Biology', 'Ecology']","['IMMU', 'ENVI', 'BIOC']",Article,0,34.0,2021

In the study, the area used vertically by the fish in the tank, the mobility rate of fish in the tank, the rate of tendency of fish in eating as soon as they were fed, whether the fish test the feed, the interspecies feed competition, the time they start to take the first feed, the duration of the feed consumption of the fish and the feed area of the fish have been considered as behavioral evaluation criteria. The trout were monitored with a camera to determine their behavior. Considering all behavioral criteria, the best polyculture rate was determined as R 66%- B 34%. Brown trout were found to be more mobile and exhibit more relaxed behavior compared to other groups in polyculture. In addition, interspecies feed competition was mostly encountered in this group. As a result, in this study, in which two different trout species were monocultured and treated at different polyculture ratios, the main factor causing behavioral change in fish was found to be the different stocking rates of fish to each other in the same tank. Different rates applied in polyculture caused unpredictable changes in behavior in both species.

All rights reserved.Various synthesis methods are being developed in order to increase the number of scientific fields where nanoparticles can be used. Recently, the biosynthesis methods have eliminated the limitations of the traditional synthesis methods such as physical and chemical ones. They have been also developed as an alternative synthesis method. With green synthesis called herbal nanofactories, primary and secondary metabolites in plants enable the reduction and capping of nanoparticles. The functional groups of alkaloids, phenolics, terpenoids, ketones, polysaccharides, proteins, vitamins, and amino acids in plants react with silver metals in ionic form and reduce “+” valued metals to “0” valued nanostructures. At the same time, functional groups of secondary metabolites form bonds with “0” valued silver nanometals and cover the surface of silver nanometals; thus, stabilization is achieved. Synthesis by biological methods provides high efficiency and rapid synthesis and the production cost of silver nanoparticle decreases. Moreover, biosynthesis is an environment-friendly technique as it takes place inside a living being. With the latest technology, silver nanoparticles stand out in the fields of biosensor and photoimaging.

Prevalence of Molecular Subtypes of Breast Carcinoma and Its Comparison between Two Different Age Groups: A Retrospective Study from a Tertiary Care Center of Northeast India,"© 2021 South Asian Journal of Cancer. All rights reserved.Objective The aim of the study is to see the prevalence of different molecular subtypes in breast cancer patients among two different age groups: ≤40 years and >40 years. Materials and Methods Retrospective study was conducted from January 2019 to December 2019. We studied 568 cases of breast carcinoma and classified them into four molecular subtypes-luminal A, luminal B, human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER 2), and triple negative. Cases were divided into two different groups: (1) ≤40 years and (2) >40 years. Statistical Analysis was done by using SPSS software version 20.0. Results Out of 568 cases, 151 (26.6%) were ≤40 years of age and 417 (73.4%) were >40 years of age. The most common histological subtype of breast cancer was ductal carcinoma in 548 cases and the most common grade was grade III. Immunohistochemistry was done in 432 patients. In younger age group, the most common molecular subtype was luminal B (31%) followed by triple negative (20%), luminal A (14%), and then HER 2 (5.3%), while in the older age group most common molecular subtype was luminal B (27.8%) followed by triple negative (14%), HER 2 (12.2%), and then luminal A (12%). Conclusion Luminal B is found to be the most common subtype in Northeast Indian women with breast cancer, as compared with other studies in which luminal A was the most common subtype. This could be due to the reason that K i-67 was not done in most of the other studies.","['BBCI', 'GNRC Hospitals']",['India'],"['Baruah A.', 'Sharma J.D.', 'Mamidala V.', 'Khanna S.', 'Ramchandani S.', 'Kakoti L.M.']","['estrogen receptor', 'human epidermal growth factor', 'luminal A', 'luminal B', 'progesterone receptor', 'triple negative']",South Asian Journal of Cancer,Georg Thieme Verlag,"['Cancer Research', 'Oncology']","['BIOC', 'MEDI']",Article,5,13.0,2021

All rights reserved.Introduction Head and neck cancers (HNCs) are increasing in Nepal and have become a major public health issue. This study aims to describe the trend of HNCs in a national tertiary cancer hospital in Nepal. Methods This was a cross-sectional study with secondary data analysis conducted at B.P Koirala Memorial Hospital, Chitwan, Nepal. The data were obtained from the medical record section and included all new HNC cases registered from 2012 to 2017. Analysis was done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 17. Subgroup analysis was done according to age, gender, site, and year. Results A total of 4,582 new HNCs were registered, of which 3,097 (67.6%) were males and 1,482 (32.4%) were females. Lip and oral cavity cancers (46.5%) were the most common HNCs followed by tonsil and pharynx (18.0%) and larynx (15.8%). The trend of HNCs shows a steady rise in incidence with difference according to the sites. HNCs were more common among males than females except for thyroid cancer. The most common age group was 60 to 74 years. Conclusions The trend of HNCs is increasing in Nepal especially oral cancers.

INTENSIVE CARE UNIT MANAGEMENT OF SARS-COV-2 PATIENTS: A NARRATIVE REVIEW,"© 2021. Taimoor Hassan, et al.The 2019 Coronavirus disease is a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). COVID-19 causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in certain individuals. In such individuals, non-invasive and invasive ventilation methods are used to treat ARDS. Non-invasive ventilation approaches must be used initially before introducing intrusive mechanical ventilation techniques. Non-invasive methods used in the therapy of COVID-19 associated ARDS include high-flow nasal cannula, bi-level positive air pressure, and helmet ventilation. Before employing any of these non-invasive methods, the risk of viral aerosol transmission to healthcare and paramedical personnel must be considered. When non-invasive procedures are used, the load on hospital ventilatory equipment can be reduced. If at all possible, avoid intubating the patient too soon. The clinical appearance of the patient, as well as vital indicators such as oxygen saturation and respiratory rate must be evaluated on frequent basis in order to determine whether the patient requires ventilation. In COVID-19 patients, the judicious application of non-invasive and invasive breathing methods can minimize the risk of death from ARDS.","['University of Lahore', 'Tianjin University', 'Changzhou University']","['China', 'Pakistan']","['Saleem F.', 'Hassan T.', 'Saeed S.', 'Naseem S.']","['Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'COVID-19 Virus', 'Health Hazards', 'Hypoxia', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Oxygen Saturation', 'Personal Protective Equipment', 'Real-Time PCR', 'SARS-CoV-2']",Gomal Journal of Medical Sciences,Gomal Medical College,"['Medicine (all)', 'Microbiology', 'Pharmacy']","['IMMU', 'MEDI', 'HEAL']",Review,0,25.0,2021

Spine Myeloid Sarcoma: A Case Series with Review of Literature,"© 2021 South Asian Journal of Cancer. All rights reserved.Myeloid sarcoma (MS) is a malignant extramedullary tumor consisting of immature cells of myeloid origin. It may precede, present concurrently or follow acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in de novo case or may also be present and might be the only manifestation of recurrent AML, myelodysplastic syndrome, or chronic myeloid leukemia. It frequently involves skin, orbit, bone, periosteum, lymph nodes, and gastrointestinal tract, soft tissue, central nervous system, and testis. Because of its different localization and symptoms, and the lack of diagnostic algorithm, MS is a real diagnostic challenge particularly in patients without initial bone marrow involvement.

"Assessment of Knowledge, Awareness and Attitude towards Oral Precancer and Cancer among Narikuravar Population in Pondicherry State","© 2021 South Asian Journal of Cancer. All rights reserved.Objective Literature revealed that oral health status and awareness about oral hygiene measures of Narikuravar tribes were very poor. There was also an increased prevalence of tobacco usage among this population. Considering this, incidence and prevalence of oral precancerous and cancerous lesions are expected to be high in this population. Surprisingly, the literature search revealed a lack of data on the awareness, knowledge, and prevalence of oral cancer and precancer in this group. The primary objective of this survey is to assess knowledge, awareness and attitude toward oral precancer and cancer among the Narikuravar tribal population in Pondicherry state. Materials and Methods This questionnaire survey is a part of the Model for Oral Cancer Eradication project conducted among the Narikuravar population in Pondicherry, which is funded by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). A total of 153 participants were recruited for the survey. A prevalidated questionnaire was used for the survey. Results The results indicated that 47% of the participants were aware of what is oral precancer and cancer. As much as 62% knew that chewing tobacco causes oral cancer and 44% thought that the growth of tissue in the mouth could be a sign of oral cancer. Almost 100% did not think that the presence of a red lesion, white lesion, or limitation of mouth opening could be signs of cancer or precancer. Only 16% thought that oral cancer is preventable. Conclusion Awareness about oral cancer and precancer is inadequate among the Narikuravar population of Pondicherry. Majority of the population is not aware of the risks, signs, or treatment options of oral precancer and cancer.

"Locational pointing in Murrinhpatha, Gija, and English conversations","© John Benjamins Publishing Company.It has been suggested that the gestural accuracy used by speakers of Australian Aboriginal languages like Guugu Yimidhirr and Arrernte to indicate directions and represent topographic features is a consequence of absolute frame of reference being dominant in these languages; and that the lackadaisical points produced by North American English speakers is an outcome of relative frame being dominant in English. We test this claim by comparing locational pointing in contexts of place reference in conversations conducted in two Australian Aboriginal languages, Murrinhpatha and Gija, and in Australian English spoken by non-Aboriginal residents of a small town in north Western Australia. Pointing behaviour is remarkably similar across the three groups and all participants display a capacity to point accurately regardless of linguistic frame of reference options.

Application of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis Scoring System in Evaluation of Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation in Patients with Acute Leukemias,"© 2021 South Asian Journal of Cancer. All rights reserved.Background Coagulation abnormalities are common in acute leukemia (AL) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) frequently complicates the onset of AL. Aim To determine the prevalence of overt DIC in AL using the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) scoring system. Materials and Methods This prospective observational study was performed on 57 newly diagnosed or relapsed cases of AL. Detailed clinical history and coagulation profile of the patients were evaluated. Diagnosis of overt and nonovert DIC was established using the ISTH scoring system and results tabulated. Observations A total of 57 patients with AL participated in the study, including 31 (54.39%) patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 26 (45.61%) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In total, 18 of 57 patients (31.58%) with AL fulfilled the criteria of overt DIC according to the ISTH scoring system, including 10 (32.25%) patients with ALL and 8 (30.76%) patients with AML. The highest prevalence of DIC was seen in the M3 subtype among AML and the L1 subtype among ALL, respectively. The mean ISTH score in patients of overt DIC in ALL and AML patients was 5.1 and 5, respectively.

Physiological and Molecular Effects of Exogenous Gibberellin (GA3) Treatment on Germination of Barley Seeds under Salt Stress Eksojen Gibberellin (GA3) Uygulamasının Tuz Stresi Altındaki Arpa Tohumlarının Çimlenmesine Fizyolojik ve Moleküler Etkileri,"© 2021, Adiyaman University. All rights reserved.Salinity is considered as one of the most important factors restricting germination parameters including rate and percentage of seed germination in crops. This study focused on the alleviating role of exogenously applied 10 mg/L gibberellic acid (GA3) on barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) seeds during germination under salt stress (120 mM NaCl). Physiological and morphological changes, and differential gene expression at 3 days after imbibition (DAI) were determined and compared with or without gibberellic acid (GA3) under salt stress. Exogenous GA3 was found to increase the shoot and root length of germinated barley seeds under salt stress by 67 and 15%, respectively, compared to those treated with salinity alone. On the other hand, exogenous GA3 treatment significantly reduced ion leakage, osmolyte accumulation, and proline content under salinity. NaCl was found to decrease the expression of the HvABI5, HvABA7 and HvKO1 by 3, 10, and 33 fold, respectively, at 3 DAI, whereas addition of GA3 in root medium rescued the expression of these genes to control levels. Besides, exogenous GA3 significantly decreased mRNA level of HvGA2ox4 under salinity during germination. This study may give insight into the relationship between salinity stress and the genes involved in GA3 metabolism and germination.",['Istanbul Üniversitesi'],['Turkey'],['Ucarli C.'],"['Barley', 'GA3', 'Germination', 'HvGA2ox4', 'HvKO1', 'Proline', 'Salinity']",Adiyaman University Journal of Science,Adiyaman University,"['Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics', 'Nuclear and High Energy Physics', 'Condensed Matter Physics', 'Applied Mathematics']","['MATH', 'PHYS']",Article,4,41.0,2021

Therefore, the atmospheric conditions of wind intensity and atmospheric pressure are analysed and is characterised the direction of the waves and its maximum height, as well as the tide variation. After the oceanographic and meteorological characterization, it´s identified and evaluated the structural damage on the coastal zone and classified the functional consequences on the port structures affected by overtopping. The quantitative analysis of atmospheric and oceanographic data, support that this overtopping is a green water type resulting from an extratropical storm arising from the rapid reduction of atmospheric pressure and an average wind velocity of 30 km/h, affecting approximately 1600 meters of the coastal area of Santa Cruz. The qualitative analysis of the consequences show that the port structures suffered severe to catastrophic consequences and a dysfunction of their normal activities. The most affected areas are at the extremes of the urban front, registering reduced to insignificant consequences, in the intermediate area.

RIVER PIRACY IN THE SERRA DO ESPIGÃO: URUGUAY AND IGUAÇU RIVERS DIVIDE-SOUTH AMERICA PIRATARIA FLUVIAL NA SERRA DO ESPIGÃO: DIVISÓRIA DOS RIOS URUGUAI E IGUAÇU-AMÉRICA DO SUL,"© 2021, APEQ - Associacao Portuguesa para o Estudo do Quaternario. All rights reserved.Stream capture is a drainage rearrangement where a flux transference occurs and a contribution area from a drainage basin is incorporated to another. It is about expanding a river system over another one, caused by erosive advantage earned by conditioning factors such as lithostructure, pluviometric regime, topographic gradient, and base level. However, in the southern region of Brazil, a rare dynamic of stream piracy was verified between the drainage basins of the Uruguay and Iguazu (Paraná) rivers. Stream captures were observed along the Serra of Espigão, part of the drainage divide between the two basins. Still, it was not possible to identify which basin was advancing over the other. This paper investigated the occurrence of stream captures, identifying which factors are responsible for this atypical stream dynamic. Mapping the stream captures by remote sensing and further validation with field work, it was verified that there is stream piracy for both sides of the drainage divide. Still it is not clear which basin is behaving more aggressively. A longitudinal profile analysis of the channels involved in the stream captures showed a local control in the drainage network. This control sets a local base level to the Iguazu river tributaries. It indicates the lithostructural limit between two different geological units: the Serra Geral group basalts and the Botucatu formation sandstones. Depending on the geographic location of this base level, channels that drain to the Iguazu (Paraná) river become more aggressive or less aggressive than the ones that drain to the Uruguai basin, and so they capture or lose area for the other basin. Therefore, it is impossible to identify a river basin that exclusively pirates the other, prevailing, in this case, a mutual competition between the Uruguai and Iguazu (Paraná) rivers basins. This fact highlights the significance of local base levels to promote stream capture processes.","['Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais', 'Universidade Federal do Parana']",['Brazil'],"['Dal Pai M.O.', 'DE PAULA E.V.', 'Salgado A.A.R.']","['Brazil', 'Drainage Rearrangement', 'Knickpoint Retreat', 'Local Base Level', 'Stream Capture']",Estudos do Quaternario,APEQ - Associacao Portuguesa para o Estudo do Quaternario,"['Paleontology', 'Earth-Surface Processes', 'Geology', 'Anthropology', 'Archeology', 'Archeology (arts and humanities)']","['SOCI', 'ARTS', 'EART']",Article,1,26.0,2021
"Factors Associated with Alcohol Consumption among Adolescents in Selected Secondary Schools in a Local Government Area of Oyo State, Southwest, Nigeria","© 2021 Lifescience Global.Alcohol use during adolescence and young adulthood remain a prominent public health problem. This study identifies factors associated with alcohol consumption among adolescents in selected secondary schools in Ibadan North Local Government Area, Southwest, Nigeria. A cross-sectional descriptive study was used. One hundred and seventy-six (176) respondents were consecutively selected using the random technique. Data were analyzed using chi-square and hypotheses tested at a 5% level of significance. Findings revealed that the majority of the respondents had poor knowledge of alcohol consumption, while (36.4%) of the respondents had consumed alcoholic beverages. Over half (54.5%) engaged in drinking alcohol as a result of peer influence. The majority (70%) of them had good knowledge of factors influencing alcohol consumption and factors influencing consumption among the respondents. Thus, the rate of alcohol consumption among adolescents was low (36.4%) as a larger percentage (64.6%) of them did not consume alcohol owing to their knowledge of the effect and the presence of some protective factors within the environment. In conclusion, alcohol consumption among adolescents was low, knowledge of its consumption was high, and it was associated with its actual consumption. Alcohol use is also associated with peer influence and environmental variables, while age and gender did not have any relationship with alcohol consumption. Therefore, educational intervention to improve knowledge of the consequences of alcohol consumption among adolescents and public policies with preventive educational campaigns was recommended.","['University College Hospital, Ibadan']",['Nigeria'],"['Jimoh S.O.', 'Olaniyi A.A.O.']","['Adolescents', 'Alcohol', 'Factors', 'Students']",International Journal of Child Health and Nutrition,Lifescience Global,"['Maternity and Midwifery', 'Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health']","['NURS', 'MEDI']",Article,1,19.0,2021
Practical Consensus Recommendations for Optimizing Risk versus Benefit of Chemotherapy in Patients with HR Positive Her2 Negative Early Breast Cancer in India,"© 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.Breast cancer is a public health challenge globally as well as in India. Improving outcome and cure requires appropriate biomarker testing to assign risk and plan treatment. Because it is documented that significant ethnic and geographical variations in biological and genetic features exist worldwide, such biomarkers need to be validated and approved by authorities in the region where these are intended to be used. The use of western guidelines, appropriate for the Caucasian population, can lead to inappropriate overtreatment or undertreatment in Asia and India. A virtual meeting of domain experts discussed the published literature, real-world practical experience, and results of opinion poll involving 185 oncologists treating breast cancer across 58 cities of India. They arrived at a practical consensus recommendation statement to guide community oncologists in the management of hormone positive (HR-positive) Her2-negative early breast cancer (EBC). India has a majority (about 50%) of breast cancer patients who are diagnosed in the premenopausal stage (less than 50 years of age). The only currently available predictive test for HR-positive Her2-negative EBC that has been validated in Indian patients is CanAssist Breast. If this test gives a score indicative of low risk (< 15.5), adjuvant chemotherapy will not increase the chance of metastasis-free survival and should not be given. This is applicable even during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","['All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi', 'Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre', 'Bhagwan Mahaveer Cancer Hospital and Research Centre', 'HCG Cancer Hospital', 'Manipal Hospital', 'Max Institute of Cancer Care', 'Asian Cancer Institute', 'Fortis Healthcare Ltd.', 'Tata Memorial Hospital', 'Shatabdi Super Speciality Hospital', 'Sparsh Hospital and Critical Care', 'Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research Kolkatta', 'Medical Oncology', 'All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhubaneswar', 'Cancer Institute India', 'Sanjeevani CBCC USA Cancer Hospital', 'Mumbai Oncocare Centre', 'Apollo Hospital', 'Kasturba Medical College, Manipal', 'Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital India']",['India'],"['Rohagi N.', 'Dattatreya P.S.', 'Deo S.V.S.', 'Doval D.', 'Krishna P.', 'Shrivastava A.', 'Bajpai J.', 'Rath G.K.', 'Sarkar D.', 'Bapna A.', 'Somashekhar S.P.', 'Vijay D.', 'Udupa K.S.', 'Thoke A.', 'Bhattacharyya G.S.', 'Chitalkar P.', 'Patil S.', 'Chaturvedi H.', 'Desai C.', 'Sharma S.', 'Bondarde S.', 'Reddy G.K.', 'Biswas G.', 'Parikh P.M.', 'Babu G.', 'Deshpande R.', 'Alurkar S.S.', 'Heroor A.', 'Majumdar S.K.', 'Malhotra H.', 'Krishnamurty A.']","['avoiding financial distress', 'avoiding toxicity', 'COVID-19', 'low- and middle-income countries', 'personalized therapy', 'precision oncology', 'saving lives']",South Asian Journal of Cancer,Georg Thieme Verlag,"['Cancer Research', 'Oncology']","['BIOC', 'MEDI']",Article,3,65.0,2023
Alterations on the Activities of Ion ATPases in the Gill and Muscle of Freshwater Mussel (Unio tigridis) Exposed to Copper Bakır Etkisinde Tatlı Su Midyelerinin (Unio tigridis) Solungaç ve Kaslarındaki İyon ATPaz Aktivitelerinin Değişimi,"© 2021, ABADER (Adıyaman Bilimsel Arastırmalar Dernegi). All rights reserved.Ion ATPases in the tissues of aquatic animals are sensitive to metal exposures. Mussels are filter-feeding animals and have a sedentary lifestyle that makes them good bio-indicator animals. Thus, the present study was carried out to investigate the effects of copper (0, 30, 90 μg/L) on the activities of Na-ATPase, Mg-ATPase, and Ca-ATPase in the gill and muscle of freshwater mussels (Unio tigridis) in different exposure durations (0, 7, 14, 21 days). Feeding of mussels during the experiments were done with the cultured unicellular algae (Cholorella vulgaris), serving them approximately 300,000 algae/ml. At the end of 21 days of exposure period, no mussel mortality was recorded. Total protein concentrations in the gill and muscle did not change significantly (P>0.05) in any exposure groups. Likewise, control ATPase activities did not alter significantly during different exposure periods. However, ATPase activities in the gill and muscle of mussels altered significantly (P<0.05) following exposure to copper, especially at the higher concentration. Although there were significant increases and decreases in the activity of Mg-ATPase in both tissues, Na-ATPase and Ca-ATPase activities did not fluctuate as there were only significant decreases at the higher exposure concentration. The present data demonstrated that copper at environmentally realistic concentrations was able to alter the activities of ion ATPases in the gill and muscle of mussels and emphasized osmoregulatory stress which mussels might face in waters contaminated with copper.",['Nigde Omer Halisdemir University'],['Turkey'],['Canli E.G.'],"['enzyme', 'Metal', 'mollusk', 'osmoregulation', 'toxicity']",Commagene Journal of Biology,ABADER (Adıyaman Bilimsel Arastırmalar Dernegi),"['Biochemistry', 'Physiology', 'Microbiology', 'Molecular Biology', 'Ecology']","['IMMU', 'ENVI', 'BIOC']",Article,3,24.0,2021
Operative Outcomes of Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy versus Open Esophagectomy for Resectable Esophageal Cancer,"© 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved.Background There is a recent rise in the incidence of esophageal carcinoma in India. Surgical resection with or without neoadjuvant chemoradiation is the current treatment modality of choice. Postoperative complications, especially pulmonary complications, affect many patients who undergo open esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. Minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) could reduce the pulmonary complications and reduce the postoperative stay. Methodology We performed a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of 114 patients with esophageal cancer in the department of surgical oncology at a tertiary cancer center in South India between January 2019 and March 2020. We included patients with resectable cancer of middle or lower third of the esophagus, and gastroesophageal junction tumors (Siewert I). MIE was performed in 27 patients and 78 patients underwent open esophagectomy (OE). The primary outcome measured was postoperative complications of Clavien-Dindo grade II or higher within 30 days. Other outcomes measured include overall mortality within 30 days, intraoperative complications, operative duration and the length of hospital stay. Results A postoperative complication rate of 18.5% was noted in the MIE group, compared with 41% in the OE group (p = 0.034). Pulmonary complications were noted in 7.4% in the MIE group compared to 25.6% in the OE group (p = 0.044). Postoperative mortality rates, intraoperative complications, and other nonpulmonary postoperative complications were almost similar with MIE as with open esophagectomy. Although the median operative time was more in the MIE group (260 minutes vs. 180 minutes; p < 0.0001), the median length of hospital stay was shorter in patients undergoing MIE (9 days vs. 12 days; p = 0.0001). Conclusions We found that MIE resulted in lower incidence of postoperative complications, especially pulmonary complications. Although, MIE was associated with prolonged operative duration, it resulted in shorter hospital stay.",['Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology India'],['India'],"['Arjunan R.', 'Chowdappa R.', 'Althaf S.', 'Premalata C.S.', 'Dharanikota A.', 'Ranganath N.']","['esophageal cancer', 'minimally invasive esophagectomy', 'open esophagectomy', 'operative outcomes', 'pulmonary complications']",South Asian Journal of Cancer,Georg Thieme Verlag,"['Cancer Research', 'Oncology']","['BIOC', 'MEDI']",Article,1,29.0,2021

This study compared the predictors of health service utilization in rural and urban areas of Ilorin East Local Government Area of Kwara State. Method: A cross-sectional study, invol ving 250 rural and 250 urban respondents sel ected through multi-stage sampling techniques. Quantitative data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Qualitative data collection was done with an FGD guide. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 16. Chi-square, t-test, and z-test were used to test for significance. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: The mean age of urban respondents was 37.1±7.9 years and 42.6 ±13.7 years for rural. Utilization among the urban respondents were 71.2%, and 89.2% among rural (z-score = 27.93; p-value = 0.01). Health services factors such as waiting time (Adjusted OR=1.012; p-value=0.989) were found to be a strong predictor of utilization among urban respondents compared with the availability of drugs (Adjusted OR= 1.696; p-value=0.407) and availability of drugs (Adjusted OR= 1.696; p-value=0.407) which were the strongest predictor among rural respondents, though they were all not statistically significant. Other factors identified were lack of staff 46.5% among rural and lack of drug 26.1% among urban communities respectively. Conclusion: The study demonstrated higher utilization among the rural community. Knowledge of available health services was important for utilization; waiting time, and availability of drugs were major predictors of health service utilization among urban and rural communities respectively.","['Federal Medical Centre Nigeria', 'University of Ilorin']",['Nigeria'],"['Ahmed A.', 'Akande T.M.', 'Ahmed A.K.', 'Osagbemi G.K.', 'Ojo O.Y.']","['Health', 'Service', 'Urban; Rural; Kwara State', 'utilization']",Babcock University Medical Journal,Babcock Medical Society,['Medicine (all)'],['MEDI'],Article,1,37.0,2020
"A Path Analysis to Identify Factors Influencing the Provision of Water in Addition to Breast Milk by Mothers of Infants under Six Months of Age in Conakry and Kindia Regions, Republic of Guinea","© 2021 Ninamou et al.; Licensee Lifescience Global.Water provision to infants under six months of age (IU6M) can hamper exclusive breastfeeding (EBF). Understanding factors and their relationships influencing this practice is needed to tailor EBF promotion programs. Using a validated questionnaire, this study aims to identify pathways in which individual factors and the environment interact to affect the provision of water in addition to breast milk among 300 mothers of IU6M. Our finding shows that 75% of mothers intended to provide water in addition to breast milk to their IU6M and that about 60% reported doing it. Results of the final path show that the subjective norm/SN (β = 0.432, p < 0.001), the attitude (β = 0.349, p < 0.001), and to a lesser extent the perceived control/PC (β = 0.141, p = 0.005) predict the intention of mothers to provide water in addition to breast milk to their IU6M. The environment scores predict the attitude (β = 0.210, p = 0.001) and the SN (β = 0.284, p < 0.001). Having the mother practicing early breastfeeding initiation at birth positively predicted the PC score (β = 0.157, p = 0.017) and predicted an increasing score of SN (β = 0.221, p = 0.003). Even though predicting the final behavior is complex, this research provides directions to nutrition education programs to tailor their content to the context and be more efficient in reducing the proportion of women providing water to their IU6M, hence contributing to the improvement of EBF.","['UNICEF', 'Ministry of Health', 'Université de Moncton']","['Equatorial Guinea', 'United States', 'Canada']","['Daffe M.', 'Ninamou N.R.', 'Zagre N.-M.', 'Blaney S.', 'Dupuis J.B.']","['Breastfeeding', 'infants', 'path analysis', 'psychosocial and environmental factors', 'theory of planned behavior', 'water']",International Journal of Child Health and Nutrition,Lifescience Global,"['Maternity and Midwifery', 'Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health']","['NURS', 'MEDI']",Article,1,44.0,2021

All rights reserved.Background Chemoport (totally implantable venous access device) and its catheter system are used to administer long-term chemotherapy in cancer patients. The objective of this study was to analyze the complications associated with chemoport insertion in various cancer patients. Material and Methods A total number of 168 chemoports along with polyurethane catheters were inserted in various cancer patients over a period of 3 years. 9.6 F polyurethane catheters were put by a team of surgical oncologists in operation theater under general or local anesthesia. Analysis of the complications was done until the chemoport was removed due to any reason. Results Out of 168 patients, 30 (17.85%) developed complications. Complications included arterial puncture, malposition of the catheter tip, pneumothorax, hematoma, seroma, deep vein thrombosis, fracture of the catheter, a reversal of port, infections, and thrombosis of the catheter. Only a few required premature port and catheter removal. Conclusion There was a low rate of complications associated with chemoport using a polyurethane type of catheter system. However, infection-related complications were comparatively more common in our series. Chemoport requires expert handling, patient education, strict follow-up, and dedicated teamwork to minimize complications.","['Fortis Memorial Research Institute', 'Santosh (Deemed to be)University', 'All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Rishikesh']",['India'],"['Mittal G.S.', 'Naik N.B.', 'Sehrawat A.', 'Sundriyal D.']","['chemoport', 'polyurethane', 'TIVAD']",South Asian Journal of Cancer,Georg Thieme Verlag,"['Cancer Research', 'Oncology']","['BIOC', 'MEDI']",Article,1,12.0,2021

Responding to thanks: From you're welcome to you bet,"© John Benjamins Publishing Company.A variety of forms serve as responses to thanks in Present-day English, albeit infrequently. Such responses minimize the debt incurred by the thanker and serve purposes of negative politeness. The history of responses to thanks has received only brief attention (Jacobsson 2002; Jucker 2020; Taavitsainen and Jucker 2020). Most of the contemporary responses to thanks (e.g., no problem and you bet) are of quite recent origin. Those that “express pleasure” (the pleasure was mine) appear in the late-nineteenth century, while those that express “verbal acknowledgment” (all right, okay) appear in the twentieth century. The increase of minimizing responses is consonant with a trend toward negative politeness, while the loss of the deferential forms found in Early Modern English (your humble servant) reflects the rise of camaraderie politeness. Responses to thanks have also undergone “attenuation” (Jucker 2019), evidenced by the appearance of short forms (welcome), the rise of verbal acknowledgment types, and the increasing use of such responses as conversational closers.",['The University of British Columbia'],['Canada'],['Brinton L.J.'],"['Early Modern English', 'Late Modern English', 'politeness', 'Present-day English', 'responses to thanks', 'thanks']",Journal of Historical Pragmatics,John Benjamins Publishing Company,"['Language and Linguistics', 'Linguistics and Language']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,47.0,2002
Politeness reciprocity in Shakespeare's dialogue: The case of thanks,"© John Benjamins Publishing Company.Recently, it has been proposed that (im)politeness in interaction today is governed in large part by a Principle of (Im)politeness Reciprocity (Culpeper and Tantucci 2021). This paper investigates whether politeness reciprocity works similarly in early modern English - specifically, in the plays of Shakespeare. Focussing on thanking behaviours, the questions of whether politeness reciprocity can be detected, and, if so, how social status might influence the nature of reciprocity, are addressed. The first part of the paper establishes that Early Modern English politeness behaviours were being discussed in terms associated with reciprocity (e.g., metaphors relating to balance and financial/commercial transactions). Then, all the instances of the two main thanking formula patterns (the verbal first person pronoun + thanks + second person pronoun and the nominal thanks) were extracted from thirty-eight plays attributed wholly or substantially to Shakespeare, and coded for a number of variables, including the weightiness of the gift for which thanks has been given, the amount of effort expended in performing thanks, and the social statuses of the Thanker and Thankee. The results show that reciprocity does govern thanking behaviours, and that social status licences imbalances in those behaviours. The paper also touches on conventionalisation.","['Department of Linguistics and English Language, Lancaster University']",['United Kingdom'],"['Tantucci V.', 'Oliver S.J.', 'Culpeper J.']","['Early Modern English', 'politeness', 'reciprocity', 'Shakespeare', 'social status', 'thanks']",Journal of Historical Pragmatics,John Benjamins Publishing Company,"['Language and Linguistics', 'Linguistics and Language']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,47.0,2021
Looking for concepts in Early Modern English: Hypothesis building and the uses of encyclopaedic knowledge and pragmatic work,"© John Benjamins Publishing Company.The idea that conceptual meaning in discourse could be identified in constellations of lexical co-occurrences in a particular “universe” of discourse was key in guiding the computational historical semantic-pragmatic work conducted in the Linguistic dna project. The project mapped prominent lexical co-occurrences across the two hundred years of publications in Early English Books Online (eebo-tcp; Text Creation Partnership edition), yielding concept models - constellations of non-adjacent lemmas that consistently co-occur across spans of up to 100 tokens. The goal was to map meaning onto concept models as “discursive concepts”, using encyclopaedic knowledge, pragmatic analysis and context. The first question concerns the effectiveness of making early hypotheses about the discursive meaning of concept models based on the inferred connections between the lemmas in a quad constellation. The second question is whether the meaning of frequent, apparently stable concept models changes upon their closer scrutiny in the discourses they lead us into. A reader familiar with the particular universe of discourse in which these quads occur, and with the social, historical, literary and philosophical traditions, and the context that they occupy, might be effectively primed by their encyclopaedic knowledge to hypothesise this discursive meaning. This paper demonstrates the efficacy of hypothesis building using encyclopaedic knowledge and pragmatic analysis to interpret optimally relevant concept models.",['The University of Sheffield'],['United Kingdom'],['Fitzmaurice S.'],"['concept models', 'discursive meaning', 'Early Modern English', 'encyclopaedic knowledge', 'hypothesis building', 'pragmatics']",Journal of Historical Pragmatics,John Benjamins Publishing Company,"['Language and Linguistics', 'Linguistics and Language']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,12.0,2000
Exchange Bias Effect in NiMnSbB Ferromagnetic Shape Memory Alloys Depending on Mn Content Bor Eklenmiş NiMnSb Ferromanyetik Şekil Hatırlamalı Alaşımlarda Exchange Bias Etkisi,"© 2021, Adiyaman University. All rights reserved.In this study, exchange bias effect was investigated in boron added NiMnSb Heusler alloys. The samples were fabricated by arc melting method with Ni49Mn37.5Sb13.5+Bx, Ni49Mn37.7Sb13.3+Bx and Ni49Mn37.9Sb13.1+Bx nominal compositions. XRD analyzes showed that the samples were in L21 crystal structure at room temperature. While the martensitic phase transition temperatures increased, the magnetic moment value decreased with the increase in Mn content. The decrease in magnetization is resulted from increase in antiferromagnetic interactions with the increase of Mn content. Under low field and zero field cooling M-T measurements revealed that antiferromagnetic interactions were more dominant at low temperature but ferromagnetic behavior was more effective in the system at high temperature region. The coexistence of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism in a magnetic material can cause the exchange bias effect. Therefore, the hysteresis loops were examined at 5 K of the samples cooled under 50 kOe magnetic field. The shift at the origin of the magnetization curve, which is attributed to the exchange bias effect, increased with increasing Mn amount.",['Inönü Üniversitesi'],['Turkey'],['Kirat G.'],"['Exchange bias effect, Antiferromagnetic interactions', 'Ferromagnetic shape memory effect', 'NiMnSb Heusler alloys']",Adiyaman University Journal of Science,Adiyaman University,"['Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics', 'Nuclear and High Energy Physics', 'Condensed Matter Physics', 'Applied Mathematics']","['MATH', 'PHYS']",Article,2,23.0,2021
A Retrospective Cohort Study of Upfront Nilotinib in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia: A Single-Center Experience,"© 2021 South Asian Journal of Cancer. All rights reserved.Context Nilotinib is a second-generation BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Aims We aim to evaluate the responses and safety of upfront Nilotinib therapy in Indian CML patients. Setting and Design We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of CML patients who received Nilotinib as an upfront treatment at our center between January 1, 2011 and October 15, 2019.The follow-up was taken till March 31, 2020. Results Forty One patients (n = 36 chronic phase and five accelerated-phase CML) received frontline Nilotinib. Median age was 39 years (21-63) with male-to-female ratio of 1.1: 1. At 3 months, 96.9% patients achieved BCR-ABL of ≤10% at international scale. By the end of 12 months, 71.5% patients achieved major molecular response (BCR-ABL ≤0.1%) and 91.4% patients achieved complete cytogenetic response assessed by BCR-ABL polymerase chain reaction of ≤1%. Common toxicities observed were weight gain, thrombocytopenia, corrected QT prolongation, and elevated serum amylase in 14 (34.1%), 7(17.07%), 4(9.7%), and 4(9.7%) patients, respectively. Overall, five patients had loss of response with further progression and death in three patients. At a median of 43.7 months, 38 patients survived with estimated 3 year event-free survival and overall survival of 65 ± 9 and 93 ± 5%.

"THE PANNEAUX ON HUNGARIAN HISTORICAL THEMES IN THE VIENNA PALACE OF THE TRANSYLVANIAN COURT CHANCELLARY AZ ERDÉLYI UDVARI KANCELLÁRIA BÉCSI PALOTÁJÁNAK MAGYAR TÖRTÉNETI TÁRGYÚ PANNÓI, AUGUST RUMEL MŰVEI 1756-1758-BÓL","© 2021 A szerzőThe topic of the paper is a cycle of six large panneaux on Hungarian historical themes panted for the Vienna palace of the Transylvanian Court Chancellery. The series on Hun-Hungarian history from leaving behind the original habitat to the battle of Mohács is the earliest relic of Hungarian history painting, yet earlier researches only tangentially touched on it despite its salient importance. When the Principality of Transylvania became part of the Central European Habsburg Monarchy as a independent land in 1690, Leopold I founded the Transylvanian Court Chancellery in 1693 as the highest governing organ of Transylvania. Based in Vienna, the office functioned in diverse rented buildings for a long time, before the freshly appointed chancellor of Transylvania Gábor Bethlen (1712-1768) purchased a building in Vienna in 1755 for the office. He chose the Sinzendorf palace in Hintere Schenkenstrasse across from the Löwel bastion (later replaced by the Burgtheater) close to the palace of the Hungarian Chancellery. It functioned until it was demolished in 1880. In 1755-1759 the chancellor had a representative suite of rooms created on the second floor also including a dining room. Its walls were covered by six large (c. 325 x 310 cm) painted wall hangings or spalliers. It is known from a description by Mór Jókai that the cycle contained three scenes from the Hun-Hungarian prehistory and three from the history of the Christian Hungarian Kingdom. 1) Exodus of the Magyars from their original habitat bordering on China; 2) Pagan priest officiating a fire sacrifice and the Hun king Attila (?), 3) Prince of Moravia Svatopluk sells Pannonia to the chieftain of the Magyars Árpád for a white horse, 4) Saint Stephen converts the Magyars to Christianity, 5) King Matthias Hunyadi enters Vienna in 1486, 6) The battle of Mohács in 1526. In a study published in 1906 Piarist historian-archivist Sándor Takáts (1860-1932) adduced several data on the artists and artisans working on interior decoration of the chancellery palace including painters, presumably on the basis of the artists' bills. These documents together with all the files of the Directorium in publicis et cameralibus perished in a fire that broke out in Vienna's Justizpalast in 1927. The Hungarian historical panneaux were presumably painted by August Rumel (1715-1778) who features in the sources as Historienmaler and painter of the Viennese citizenry. On the basis of indirect information, the cycle can be tentatively dated to 1756-1758, as they were already included in the inventory of the chancellery in 1759. The Transylvanian Court Chancellery hardly used its first headquarters for one and a half decades after 1766. When in 1782 Joseph II merged the Transylvanian and Hungarian chancelleries, the Transylvanian office moved in 1785 next door to its sister institution, which had had a palace since 1747 a street further, in Vordere Schenkenstrasse, i.e. today's Bankgasse. They moved in the one-time Trautson house. Parallel with that the treasury sold the former centre of the Transylvanian chancellery which was bought by imperial and royal chamberlain Count Mihály Nádasdy (1746-1826). As far as Jókai knew, the panneaux became court property in the 1780s and they were purchased at an auction in 1809 by Countess Rozália Bethlen (1754-1826) and transported to Transylvania. They can be identified in the chattels inventory for 1839 of the Jósika palace in Kolozsvár. Later the panneaux were inherited within the Jósika family. Elected minister a latere in 1895, Sámuel Jósika (1848-1923) had the cycle transported to Vienna and put them up in the “Hungarian house”, his official place, today the house of the Hungarian embassy. When his incumbency expired, the pictures went back to Transylvania and passed down in the Jósika family. In 1945 four of the pictures got lost. The two surviving pictures were purchased by the Hungarian State and hung up in the gala room of the Hungarian Embassy in Vienna in 2008 where they can still be seen.",['Institute and Museum of Military History Budapest'],['Hungary'],['Serfozo S.'],"['August Rumel (1715-1778)', 'baroque painting', 'Gábor Bethlen (1712-1768)', 'iconography']",Muveszettorteneti Ertesito,Akademiai Kiado ZRt.,"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'History']",['ARTS'],Article,0,82.0,2021

SZáZAD ELSŒ éVTIZEDéBEN,"© 2021 A szerzőAround 1903-04 there was an outstanding number of sacral design competitions in Hungary, two of which at first glance seem very similar, and their juxtaposition even seemed to be a way of drawing more general conclusions. the Ministry of agriculture was looking for plans for churches in designs for villages to be settled by the state treasury, while the archdiocese of Kalocsa was looking for designs for Catholic churches to be built on the outskirts of subotica. the calls for proposals were for buildings of roughly the same size, a year apart, both seeking a solution to a pressing, long-standing problem. the problem was architectural, simply put: many churches were missing. the tendering process was not cheap, but it was the most efficient way to obtain many plans at once. Comparing the competitions, various aspects were taken into account, firstly, the similarities and differences between the procedures, which were mainly due to the characteristics differences between of the institutions commissioning the work. the second was an architectural analysis, clarifying issues of building size, and then we looked at the characteristics of the design and layout. in this context, we reviewed the texts of the judging reports and made general observations on the two juries. the longer more extended, more professional review was analysed with the aim of reconstructing from the comments, summarising the criteria of the critique, the possible ideal types against which the judges compared the entries. as a result, we have registered a kind of transition in sacral architecture in the mid-1900s, in which traditional form and spatial shaping were dominant, but also the signs of a later formalisation that would come to fruition in the 1910s. this transition can also be observed in professional texts on architecture, which evolved into professional writing that flourished in the years leading up to the First World War.","['BME Csonka pál Doktori Iskola', 'BME építészettörténeti és Műemléki Tanszék']",['Hungary'],"['Marotzy K.', 'Nemeth N.']",,Muveszettorteneti Ertesito,Akademiai Kiado ZRt.,"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'History']",['ARTS'],Article,0,27.0,2021

The decoration, created in 1697, visualizes the prayer Salve Regina, and its content is closely connected to the jesuit spiritual exercise of meditation. According to my interpretation, the emblems of the staircase offered a visual aid to the jesuit clerks, for their meditations on the significance of holy Mary. The emblems, thus, embody the idea of “Ut pictura meditatio”, as defined by Walter S. Melion. I offer an analysis of the meditational programme of the decoration of the Győr staircase, and a brief outline of its place in late 17th-century devotional emblematics. The source of the emblematic decoration could be found in the context of jesuit emblem literature and applied emblematics. Besides several analogous emblematic publications, according to my research, the visual source for the Győr programme was the Salve regina print-series by the Antwerp artist Anton Wierix. Through an analysis of this source, I aim to distance the interpretation of the staircase's decoration from the former attempt of Éva Knapp, proposing that the decoration was based on creative visual translations of emblem-descriptions by jacob Masen. Through my interpretation of the emblems and their overall programme, the decoration of the Győr college could be placed in the context of jesuit meditation and applied emblematics. I also aim to elaborate on the practical function of the decorative programme, and thus widening our knowledge on early modern practices of emblematic meditation in monastic communities.",['Museum of Fine Arts'],['Hungary'],['Kusler A.'],"['Anton Wierix', 'Applied eblematics', 'Győr', 'Salve regina', 'Staircase of the jesuit college']",Muveszettorteneti Ertesito,Akademiai Kiado ZRt.,"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'History']",['ARTS'],Article,0,105.0,2021

Construction of Comprehensive Geological Model for an Iraqi Oil Reservoir,"© 2021, Union of Iraqi Geologists. All rights reserved.The paper generates a geological model of a giant Middle East oil reservoir, the model constructed based on the field data of 161 wells. The main aim of the paper was to recognize the value of the reservoir to investigate the feasibility of working on the reservoir modeling prior to the final decision of the investment for further development of this oilfield. Well log, deviation survey, 2D/3D interpreted seismic structural maps, facies, and core test were utilized to construct the developed geological model based on comprehensive interpretation and correlation processes using the PETREL platform. The geological model mainly aims to estimate stock-tank oil initially in place of the reservoir. In addition, three scenarios were applied based on sensitivity and uncertainty of five variables to determine an accurate estimation of stock-tank oil initially in place of the reservoir. The oil-water contact appeared to be the major uncertain parameter for stock-tank oil initially in place estimation because the available geological and field data was not enough to demonstrate it confidently, and only 13% of the total wells have penetrated the water zone in the Mishrif formation. The results of all scenarios indicate that the reservoir has huge stock-tank oil initially in place. The importance of developing this oilfield is validated by its very high stock-tank oil. This is where the value of this study becomes obvious.","['Curtin University', 'University of Baghdad', 'Basra Oil Company']","['Australia', 'Iraq']","['Mahmood H.A.', 'Al-Fatlawi O.F.']","['Geological model', 'Middle East field', 'Petrel', 'Stock-tank oil initially in place']",Iraqi Geological Journal,Union of Iraqi Geologists,['Geology'],['EART'],Article,3,33.0,2021
An advanced endoscopic surgery robotic platform for removal of early-stage gastrointestinal cancer using endoscopic submucosal dissection,"© 2021 The Hong Kong Institution of Engineers.Two gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, stomach and colorectal cancer, have the fifth and third highest incident rates and the fourth and second highest mortality rates among all cancers, respectively. Combined, they had 2.8 million new cases and 1.6 million deaths annually. Fortunately, early-stage GI cancer has a high five-year survival rate if the tumour can be removed completely. Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is the gold standard for the removal of early-stage GI cancer as it has a high rate of en-bloc resection and a low rate of recurrence. However, ESD is a very technically challenging surgical operation. It has a relatively high rate of failure, including perforation of the stomach or colon. Therefore, a surgical robotic platform with high dexterity and better ergonomics is in high demand, which can ease the technical problems induced by conventional ESD procedures. In our previous study, a prototype of an endoscopic surgery robotic platform was built and the preliminary experimental results showed that the dual flexible arm robotic platform with wire-driven continuum structure was capable of increasing the efficiency and safety in performing ESD under the master-slave controlling scheme. An advanced robotic platform was built based on this prototype to achieve higher flexibility and production requirements. The design of these two platforms and experimental results will be presented in detail.","['Chinese University of Hong Kong', 'Chinese University of Hong Kong, Faculty of Medicine']",['Hong Kong'],"['Chiu P.W.Y.', 'Lau K.C.', 'Yam Y.']","['Continuum structure', 'Early-stage GI cancer', 'Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection', 'Endoscopic surgery', 'Flexible robot', 'Surgical robot', 'Tendon-sheath mechanism']",HKIE Transactions Hong Kong Institution of Engineers,Hong Kong Institution of Engineers,['Engineering (all)'],['ENGI'],Article,1,22.0,2021

Is it unlawful to favour oneself?,"© 2022 The Author(s).The leveraging of market power by digital ecosystems and self-preferencing have become fashionable topics nowadays at national, European, and international levels. However, they are not novel issues. This paper argues that we can find the underlying concepts in a number of practices previously identified as abusive, such as tying and bundling, margin squeeze, and refusal to deal. This paper points out that these abuses have certain similarities with self-preferencing. This supports the claim that self-preferencing is likely to be conceivable under EU competition law as a new abuse. The investigations launched by the Commission after the adoption of the Google Shopping decision-such as against Amazon and Apple, the Amazon case of the Italian Competition Authority, as well as the various expert reports, and the legislative proposals that have been put forward in this regard also point in this direction. However, many questions remain when it comes to the legal standards that are applicable to the assessment of whether self-preferencing is abusive in a given situation.","['Pazmany Peter Katolikus Egyetem', 'Mathias Corvinus Collegium']",['Hungary'],['Csurgai-Horvath G.'],"['Abuse of dominance', 'digital platforms', 'leveraging', 'self-preferencing']",Hungarian Journal of Legal Studies,Akademiai Kiado ZRt.,['Law'],['SOCI'],Article,0,28.0,2022

Potential explanations are manifold.

The ghost of Vulgar Latin History of a misnomer,"© John Benjamins Publishing Company.The concept of a colloquial variety of Latin as an intermediate variety between Latin and the Romance languages has a long standing. Sometimes called Vulgar or Popular Latin, this variety is often conceptualized as a discrete linguistic variety, which is held responsible for the changes in the provincial realization of Latin. Since a great deal of evidence for this variety is collected from written texts, studies on the emergence of the Romance languages have tended to ignore the actual process of language acquisition in the provinces of the Roman empire. In the present paper I draw attention to the work of two early scholars, the Italian Celso Cittadini (1533-1627) and the Frenchman Pierre-Nicolas Bonamy (1694-1770), who did concern themselves with the acquisition of Latin, referring to the role of the Roman army in spreading the Latin language throughout the empire. Their suggestions about the process of Latinization can be substantiated with data on the military presence in the provinces of the Roman empire.",['Radboud Universiteit'],['Netherlands'],['Versteegh K.'],,Historiographia Linguistica,John Benjamins Publishing Company,"['History', 'Language and Linguistics', 'Linguistics and Language']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,77.0,1533

"The Invisible Church: C. P. E. Bach, Die Israeliten in der Wüste - A Freemasonic Oratorio?","© 2021 The Author(s).The miracle narrative of the first oratorio by C. P. E. Bach – the escape of the people of Israel from the thirst death by Moses – comes from the Book of Exodus. In the course of the second part of the work, however, the figure of Moses is unexpectedly taken over by the Redeemer. The place turns out to be a paraphrase of Genesis 3:15. In the context of the German Enlightenment the biblical story can be interpreted as a reference to the assimilation process of the Jewish community. The composed libretto includes an interpolation, which speaks about the real advent of the Messiah, thus placing the work among the representatives of the messianic-cult of the Enlightenment. The interpolated text section focuses on the religion above religions as imagined by the latitudinarianism of the leading philosophers of the Enlightenment and testifies to the Masonic spirit in it. The text of the final chorus re-interprets the church dedication (the original function of Bach’s oratorio) as the dedication of the invisible Church: the soul.",['Eötvös Loránd Tudományegyetem'],['Hungary'],['Dolinszky M.'],"['Enlightenment', 'Freemasonry', 'German oratorio', 'Jewish emancipation', 'recitativo accompagnato']",Studia Musicologica,Akademiai Kiado ZRt.,['Music'],['ARTS'],Article,0,33.0,2021
Bartók’s Most Daring Concept of a Palindromic Structure: The Sonata-Form Opening Movement of the Fifth Quartet,"© 2021 The Author(s).In movement I of String Quartet no. 5 inversion shapes of the themes are recapitulated in reverse order – probably the most daring concept of a palindromic structure of a sonata-form movement in Bartók’s realm. After all, for him a strict hin und zurück form with strong thematic characters was unthinkable. Already the strategy of this opening movement involved danger. If Theme I after a transition leads to Theme II, which leads to Theme III, as a dramatic series of actions, how could the reverse order of these themes be “natural”? To minimize the danger, in this movement Bartók reconsidered the usual dramaturgy of the exposition. Instead of a continuous growth of the musical “scenes” welded together, he presented three thematic blocks very much different in character, heavily punctuated by fragments of the first theme. Therefore, dramatic contrast rather than organic development is the key term, and so the reverse order of the thematic blocks in the recapitulation is less artificial.",['Institute for Musicology'],['Hungary'],['Somfai L.'],"['Béla Bartók', 'Kolisch Quartet', 'sonata form', 'String Quartet no. 5']",Studia Musicologica,Akademiai Kiado ZRt.,['Music'],['ARTS'],Article,0,12.0,2021
The Forgotten Youth of Sándor Veress,"© 2021 The Author(s).Although Sándor Veress achieved his first significant successes in Hungary and abroad at the turn of the 1930s and 1940s, musicological research still remains indebted to the detailed analysis of the composer’s career related to the history of Hungarian music and cultural life. Based on press and archival documents, letters and recollections, and the historical literature of the period as well, the present study attempts to explore the socio-cultural environment that characterized and helped to unfold Veress’s development. My study looks at the composer’s network of contacts, his family ties and the political-ideological movements and relations with the Reformed Church that promoted his career, and examines their direct influence on Sándor Veress’s works composed during this period, especially The Miraculous Flute (1937), the Japanese Symphony (1940) and Térszili Katica (1943).",['Institute for Musicology'],['Hungary'],['Dalos A.'],"['Bartók', 'fascism', 'Japanese Symphony', 'Kodály', 'music', 'politics', 'Sándor Veress']",Studia Musicologica,Akademiai Kiado ZRt.,['Music'],['ARTS'],Article,0,213.0,2021
Concealed Fragmentariness: On the Compositional Process of Bartók’s String Quartets,"© 2021 The Author(s).The present paper is a preliminary study to a deeper understanding of Bartók’s compositional process: how he filled the music paper even if the notation appears continuous. He did not always write the draft from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner but occasionally skipped some measures or phrases that he intended to write down later. Thus, the continuity draft is not necessarily regarded as a continuity; it might have consisted of fragments but they have been eventually concealed in the final form of the draft. This may directly affect our interpretation of Bartók’s creative process. The present research takes the visual appearance of a draft as a clue to examine its hypothetical fragmentariness. Beginning with the examination of some actual blank spaces that were never filled, the paper deals with cases where the original existence of fragments is suggested by the extraordinary appearance of the draft, such as a blank space at the end of a system, notations in the margin, re-organization of bar-lines, etc. Besides systematic approaches to fragmentariness, the author offers some interpretation concerning the reasons why Bartók did not write the draft in an ordinary way. There might have been different explanations for the interruption of the linear compositional process. One of the important findings of this paper is that Bartók’s bar-lines do not always mark metric accents but sometimes simply facilitate the performers’ orientation. Even though the occasional special function of some of his bar-lines as mere markers of orientation is explained by Bartók in a letter to Rudolf Kolisch, the existence of philological evidence to this effect may further underline its validity and importance.",['Institute for Musicology'],['Hungary'],['Nakahara Y.'],"['Bartók', 'compositional process', 'sketch study', 'String Quartet no. 4 (BB 95)', 'String Quartet no. 5 (BB 110)']",Studia Musicologica,Akademiai Kiado ZRt.,['Music'],['ARTS'],Article,0,94.0,2021
Zoltán Kodály and Hungarian Dance,"© 2021 The Author(s).In addition to folk music, Zoltán Kodály was interested in folk dance. This is evidenced not only by his writings dedicated to the subject – some relevant ideas are to be found in his publications mainly focused on other topics. In this article, the author collects both Kodály’s writings explicitly related to folk dance as well as the “hidden” ideas, presented partly chronologically, partly in thematic groups. Topics include: Kodály’s dance experiences, his practical dance knowledge, his work of exploring data of historical dance music, his role in the emergence of Hungarian ethnochoreology as a scholarly discipline, his critical views on the use of folk dance on stage, etc. In contrast to the earlier literature, this article no longer considers the Hungarian shepherds’ horn signals as the inspirational sources for Bécsi harangjátek [Viennese Clock], a movement which imitates a musical clock in Kodály’s Singspiel Háry János. The movement entitled Branle de village, part of seventeenth-century Austrian composer Johann Heinrich Schmelzer’s Partita ex Vienna, contains some bars that bear a close resemblance to the repeated main motif of Kodály’s Viennese Clock. It is safe to assume that Branle de village was Kodály’s source of inspiration, given that there is evidence that he studied the DTÖ-collection of Schmelzer’s works: he referred to this volume where he found a Styrian version of a Székely dance tune.",['Institute for Musicology'],['Hungary'],['Pavai I.'],"['dance knowledge', 'Dances of Galánta', 'Dances of Marosszék', 'Kálló Double Dance', 'Zoltán Kodály']",Studia Musicologica,Akademiai Kiado ZRt.,['Music'],['ARTS'],Article,0,73.0,2021
"The Fourth of the Fourth: On the Genesis and the Early Performances of the Allegretto, pizzicato Movement of Béla Bartók’s String Quartet No. 4","© 2021 The Author(s).As already pointed out by László Somfai in the late 1980s, Béla Bartók’s first fully developed five-movement realization of the so-called “bridge” or “palindrome” form was only an afterthought, a further development of a composition originally intended as a cycle of four movements only. As also discussed briefly by Somfai, the evolution of the Allegretto, pizzicato movement itself had distinct stages. A recently surfaced source further clarifies these compositional phases, among others confirms the existence of a 140-measure-long version without a proper conclusion, which, at one point, the composer considered as a definitive version (for which only the ending needed to be composed) and tested with the Waldbauer-Kerpely Quartet. The present article re-examines the compositional process of Bartók’s String Quartet no. 4 with an emphasis on its additional fourth movement and discusses the different compositional phases of the Allegretto, pizzicato.","['Institute for Musicology', 'Liszt Ferenc Zenemuvészeti Egyetem']",['Hungary'],['Nemeth Z.'],"['Béla Bartók', 'genesis', 'Imre Waldbauer', 'source study', 'string quartet']",Studia Musicologica,Akademiai Kiado ZRt.,['Music'],['ARTS'],Article,1,36.0,2021
Business Succession: An Opportunity to Cooperate La succession d’entreprise: une occasion de coopérer,"© 2021, University of Alberta Library. All rights reserved.A vast proportion of Quebec’s economic fabric is made up of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Recent studies underline the importance of ensuring the succession of these SMEs for the coming years. The collective option of cooperative takeover makes it possible to maintain the activities of these companies and to save the jobs they provide by selling the companies to employees or members of the community through conversion into cooperatives. However, this option has been largely neglected, which constitutes a missed opportunity for communities. Since 1980, 106 cooperatives have taken over a business in Quebec to ensure its continuity under this new status. The data show that, as of July 1, 2021, 96% of the cooperatives affected by these takeovers since 1980 were still in operation. This sustainability, including the maintenance of jobs and local economic activity, constitutes an argument in favour of exploring the cooperative model as an avenue for business takeovers.",['Université de Sherbrooke'],['Canada'],"['Guillotte C.-A.', 'Charbonneau J.', 'Merrien A.-M.', 'Fouquet E.']","['Business succession', 'Cooperative conversion']",Canadian Journal of Nonprofit and Social Economy Research,University of Alberta Library,"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Social Sciences (miscellaneous)']",['SOCI'],Article,0,13.0,2021

The role of immune mediators in pathogenesis of hepatitis B virus infection,"© 2021, Indian Association of Biomedical Scientists. All rights reserved.Introduction and Aim: Viral hepatitis, is considered a major cause of cirrhosis and liver transplantation, both of which are life-threatening conditions. In comparison to Hepatitis C virus infection, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has a lower rate of chronicity. The purpose of this study is to assess the immunological particles CD2 and CD4, as well as the cytokines IL-10, in HBV-infected patients. Materials and Methods: Between April and June 2021, a case-control study was conducted on 180 female subjects with a mean age of 35 years who visited a private clinic in Mosul city. A (10 ml) sample of blood was collected from each subject by routine venipuncture technique, and the blood sample was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the plasma, which was used for further investigations. The ELISA test was used to determine the sizes of cytokines in the serum (R&D Systems). A microplate reader was used to limit absorbance in copies (Beckman Coulter). The last concentration was measured in pg/ml. Results: The findings of this study revealed that (15%) of cases had clinical symptoms of HBV, while (70%) of cases were asymptomatic, and (5%) of cases progressed to chronic liver disease. In compared to healthy control groups, HBV patients had highly significant variations in mean CD 2 and CD 4 expression (p<0.0001). Conclusion: During the acute phase of hepatitis, the immune system successfully fights off the infection; however, differences in immune responses to different viruses may explain the tendency for acute infection to resolve rather than develop to chronic infection. Hepatitis viruses employ a variety of tactics to evade human immunity. To fully comprehend the complicated interplay between immunological mediators and HBV infection, more research is needed.",['Ninevah University'],['Iraq'],['Abdul-Qaderkhuder H.'],"['Cytokines', 'Hepatitis B virus', 'Interferons', 'Interleukin']",Biomedicine (India),Indian Association of Biomedical Scientists,"['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)']",['BIOC'],Article,0,25.0,2021

Melatonin and Epilepsy,"This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY 4.0), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disease with recurrent seizures. Its incidence, the social and psychological aspects of epilepsy-associated stigmatization in society, the medical risk of severe seizures, and the challenges in treatment confirm its medical and social significance. The pathogenesis of the diseases is associated with abnormal activity of a population of neurons due to various mechanisms, the most frequent being oxidative stress, glutamate excitotoxicity, and mitochondrial dysfunction. In the last 3-4 decades, the possible connection between epilepsy and melatonin - a neurohormone secreted by the pineal gland - has been sought and studied. Various physiological functions of melatonin in humans have been proven - regulation of circadian rhythms (diurnal, seasonal), sleep and wakefulness, participation in the processes of thermoregulation, tumour growth and aging, sexual activity and reproductive functions. It also has immunomodulatory, cytoprotective and antioxidant activity. The results from the studies with experimental models with animals conducted so far in search of a correlation between melatonin and epileptogenesis are mainly in support of the hypothesis of its anticonvulsant effect. The studies with humans are diverse in design, with a smaller number of participants, and the results are not always in explicit support of this hypothesis. The correlation between melatonin concentration and the course of the disease in patients with epilepsy has been discussed. The possibility of adding melatonin to anti-epileptic therapy has also been studied recently.",['Medical University of Plovdiv'],['Bulgaria'],['Vasileva Z.'],"['anticonvulsant', 'antioxidant', 'melatonin serum concentration', 'neuroprotective', 'seizures']",Folia medica,NLM (Medline),['Medicine (all)'],['MEDI'],Article,1,,1961
Shear Bond Strength of Self-Adhesive Composite Containing TiO2 and SiO2 Nanoparticles with an Additional Etching Step for Orthodontic Brackets Bonding to Enamel,"This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY 4.0), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.INTRODUCTION: Recently, nanoparticles such as nano-TiO2 have been added to some dental materials for enhancing dental carries prevention due to their antibacterial activity. AIM: This study aimed to assess the shear bond strength of a self-adhesive composite containing TiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles for orthodontic bracket bonding. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This in vitro, experimental study was done on 70 extracted human premolars divided into 7 groups. Six groups of Vertise Flow self-adhesive composite samples were prepared: without any nanoparticles, with 0.5% and 1% TiO2 nanoparticles, 0.5% and 1% SiO2 nanoparticles, and 1% mixture of TiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles so that nano-hybrid composites were prepared. Metal brackets were bonded with these samples as well as Transbond XT as the control group. The shear bond strength of the brackets to enamel was measured using a universal testing machine. The adhesive remnant index (ARI) score was also determined by a stereomicroscope. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA, Tukey's test and Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: The shear bond strength of the groups was significantly different (p=0.000). Pairwise comparisons revealed that the bond strength of Transbond XT group was significantly higher than others (p<0.05), followed by the 1% TiO2 group with significant differences with Vertise Flow and 0.5% TiO2 groups. The lowest value belonged to Vertise Flow with no nanoparticles. The ARI scores was different in the control group (p=0.000). CONCLUSIONS: Adding TiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles to Vertise Flow self-adhesive composite not only did not adversely affect its shear bond strength, but also slightly increased it. Overall, the self-adhesive nano-hybrid composite containing TiO2 and/or SiO2 nanoparticles, following an additional etching step would be acceptable for bracket bonding and can be used clinically to benefit from the antimicrobial activity of these nanoparticles.","['Radiation Application Research School', 'Tehran University of Medical Sciences', 'Dentist']",['Iran'],"['Saffarpour A.', 'Saffar Shahroudi A.', 'Sodagar A.', 'Akhavan A.', 'Nikpour S.']","['nanoparticles', 'orthodontic brackets', 'self-adhesive composite', 'shear bond strength', 'TiO2-SiO2']",Folia medica,NLM (Medline),['Medicine (all)'],['MEDI'],Article,1,,1961
Weight Gain after Treatment of Thyroid Dysfunction and Thyroid Surgery,"This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY 4.0), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Thyroid surgery is generally recommended for malignant conditions and for some benign thyroid disorders. Many patients report weight gain after thyroidectomy especially during the first months following surgery. Studies on patients with Graves' disease treated either with antithyroid drugs or radioiodine confirm that these patients frequently gain weight after restoration of thyroid function. Other studies have also shown that there is considerable weight gain after thyroidectomy for both nodular goiter and thyroid cancer. Transient hypothyroidism during the postoperative period is often thought to be associated with weight gain after thyroidectomy. The role of a number of adipocytokines and their interaction with the thyroid function has been investigated in the pathogenesis of weight changes. Levothyroxine replacement or suppressive therapy after thyroidectomy has a different impact on the metabolic parameters independent of TSH levels. The long-term effects of the impaired T3/T4 ratio are not fully understood as there are no sensitive markers to assess the biological response of target organs and tissues. Future studies are needed to identify such parameters, provide new considerations for the treatment of patients after total thyroidectomy, and help determine individual target hormone levels to ensure a sustained euthyroid state.",['Medical University of Plovdiv Faculty of Medicine'],['Bulgaria'],"['Nonchev B.', 'Argatska A.']","['Graves’ disease', 'levothyroxine', 'thyroid-stimulating hormone', 'thyroidectomy', 'weight gain']",Folia medica,NLM (Medline),['Medicine (all)'],['MEDI'],Article,0,,1961
A Comparative Study on Intranasal Versus Intravenous Lorazepam in the Management of Acute Seizure in Children,"This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY 4.0), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.INTRODUCTION: The acute seizure in childhood is a medical emergency which is usually managed by benzodiazepines used as a first line of therapy. There are no strict guidelines of using intranasal lorazepam in India. Many paediatricians use it in an emergency situation as it is inexpensive, easy to administer and even treatment can be started at home. Very few studies are available to compare efficacy and safety of intravenous lorazepam with intranasal lorazepam in childhood seizure, though both routes have comparable pharmacokinetic profile. Intravenous lorazepam (0.1 mg/kg) is already recommended as a first-line treatment of acute childhood seizures in India. There are very few studies regarding the usefulness of intranasal lorazepam. With this background, we compared intranasal lorazepam with the more widely accepted intravenous lorazepam for control of acute seizure. AIM: To compare effectiveness and safety of intranasal and intravenous lorazepam in acute seizure in children aged 5-12 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is an analytical observational cross-sectional study involving patients with acute seizure who received lorazepam via either the intravenous or intranasal route. Formulation and dosage of lorazepam were the same in both routes. RESULTS: Distributions of patient groups according to sex, age, and weight were statistically not significant (p=0.42, p=0.391, and p=0.605, respectively). Time to control seizure within 10 min and persistent cessation of seizure activity were similar in both groups. Safety parameters showed no differences statistically. CONCLUSIONS: Though intravenous lorazepam is recommended as first-line treatment, intranasal lorazepam may be a good alternative choice in a convulsing child.","['Raiganj Government Medical College and Hospital', 'Burdwan Medical College &amp; Hospital', 'Kalna Subdivisional &amp; Superspeciality Hospital']",['India'],"['Ghosh T.', 'Rudra N.', 'Roy U.K.']","['children', 'efficacy', 'intranasal', 'intravenous', 'lorazepam', 'seizure']",Folia medica,NLM (Medline),['Medicine (all)'],['MEDI'],Article,2,,1961

Liquid biopsy is an innovative, non-invasive method which is used both for diagnostic purposes and for therapeutic monitoring. Liquid biopsy has the potential to help manage non-small cell lung cancer throughout all stages of this cancer: screening, detection of minimal residual disease to guide adjuvant treatment, early detection of relapse, systemic treatment initiation, monitoring of response to targeted or immune therapy, and the emergence of resistance to applied treatment.

Efficacy of Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis for the Evaluation of Physical Impairment in Chronic Low Back Pain. Results from a Cohort Study,"This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY 4.0), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.INTRODUCTION: Determining the effect of body composition on chronic low back pain seems to have the potential to improve our understanding of its mechanism and to develop novel preventive and therapeutic approaches. Aim: The purpose of the present study was to assess by electrical impedance the composition of lower extremities of individuals with chronic low back pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty-one adult participants with diagnosed chronic low back pain were recruited in this study. The study activities were divided into three phases: phase 1 - self-administered questionnaires, phase 2 - biomedical examination (including anthropometric measurements and physical function performance tests), and phase 3 - bioimpedance analysis. RESULTS: Our results showed that chronic low back pain differentiates the circumference of thigh and calf of the symptomatic leg. Besides, patients experience pain also in hip, thigh, and calf, which act as a barrier to patient's personal, professional, social, and recreational activities. Furthermore, patients appear with 'unstable' walking, reduced balance, and reduced general physical condition that affect all of the neuromuscular structures of the locomotor system. Interestingly, patients seem to be characterized by a tendency to deposit fat and to decrease muscle mass in the symptomatic limb regardless of the gender. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we determine the profile of a patient with chronic low back pain through a variety of measurements. Chronic low back pain causes several structural changes to the symptomatic leg of the patients leading to 'unstable' walking, reduced balance, and reduced general physical condition. It is clear that further studies using bioimpedance analysis are needed to address the concerns raised by investigating a multifactorial condition such as chronic low back pain.",['Democritus University of Thrace'],['Greece'],"['Tilkeridis K.', 'Drosos G.', 'Karaglani M.', 'Chatzipapas C.', 'Ververidis A.', 'Kechagias D.']","['bioimpedance analysis', 'body composition', 'low back pain']",Folia medica,NLM (Medline),['Medicine (all)'],['MEDI'],Article,0,,1961
The Role of Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Regulating PDGF and VEGF during Pancreatic Islet Cells Regeneration in Diabetic Animal Model,"This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY 4.0), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.INTRODUCTION: Diabetes is a heterogeneous group of metabolic diseases characterized by elevated blood glucose due to autoimmune disorder or a combination of insulin resistance and insulin deficiency. VEGF and PDGF are the main actors in the regeneration of damaged pancreatic tissue. However, the prolonged release of these molecules may induce fibrosis formation. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have a high potential to regenerate damaged pancreatic tissue by releasing PDGF and VEGF. AIM: This study aimed to investigate the effect of MSCs on the levels of PDGF and VEGF on days 2 and 44 in diabetic mice and determine the number of pancreatic islet cells and blood glucose levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study used a post-control group design with animals divided into five groups: sham, control, and three treatment groups (P) which were given MSCs at doses of 1.5×105, 3×105, and 6×105 cells. The levels of PDGF, VEGF, and blood glucose were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), while the number of pancreatic islet cells was analyzed using H&E staining. RESULTS: This study showed a significant increase of VEGF and PDGF levels on day 2 and a significant increase in islet cell percentages on day 44 in line with the decreased blood glucose level. However, there was no difference between VEGF and PDGF levels on day 44. CONCLUSIONS: MSCs regulate PDGF and VEGF levels in wound healing phases and remodel pancreatic islet β-cells regeneration to control blood glucose in diabetic model mice.","['Universitas Diponegoro', 'Universitas Islam Sultan Agung Semarang', 'Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta', 'Universitas Sumatera Utara']",['Indonesia'],"['Rahmi F.L.', 'Muhar A.M.', 'Suwiryo Z.H.', 'Widyatmoko A.', 'Putra A.']","['diabetes', 'MSCs', 'PDGF', 'VEGF']",Folia medica,NLM (Medline),['Medicine (all)'],['MEDI'],Article,2,,1961

Three Cases of Plagiarism?

These books display remarkable similarities. They contain, among other subjects, a vocabulary, a grammar, useful Arabic phrases and Egyptian weights and measures. Zenker, Sacroug and De Vaujany & Radouan copied extensively from Nolden’s book without referring to the original source. However, these three textbooks are not exact copies (or, in the case of Sacroug, not an exact translation) of Nolden’s book: although the authors took Nolden’s Vocabulaire as their basis, they also considerably reworked it and added extra materials.

This study was conducted in 16 institutions, 8 of which are Youth Centers and 8 of which are Public Education Centers, which provide amateur music education in Erzurum, Ağrı, Van and Hakkari provinces. The data of the research were collected through face-to-face interviews with 28 teachers who gave instrument lessons in the Youth and Public Education centers in the provinces determined within the scope of the study. The obtained data were analyzed with frequency and percentage from content analysis and descriptive statistics methods.

In both types of training centers, it was determined that most of the trainers used both the theoretical explanation and demonstration methods in the instrument training process, and the method/etude/module was the most used course material in the instrument training process. It has been determined that the teachers teaching in both institutions have a curriculum that they use, but most of the time they do not comply with this curriculum and implement their own plans. At the end of the course at GM; that most of the teachers do not measure and evaluate and/or make a general self-assessment, while in HEM most of the teachers take an exam at the end of the course; In both institutions, it was determined that a course completion certificate or certificate was mostly given at the end of the instrument training process.",['Atatürk Üniversitesi'],['Turkey'],"['Akcay S.O.', 'Kizilyildiz V.']","['amateur music education', 'instrument education', 'Music education', 'non-formal education', 'youth']",Online Journal of Music Sciences,Nilgun SAZAK,['Music'],['ARTS'],Article,0,34.0,2022
Making sense of spoken plurals,"© 2023 John Benjamins Publishing Company.Distributional semantics offers new ways to study the semantics of morphology. This study focuses on the semantics of noun singulars and their plural inflectional variants in English. Our goal is to compare two models for the conceptualization of plurality. One model (FRACSS) proposes that all singular-plural pairs should be taken into account when predicting plural semantics from singular semantics. The other model (CCA) argues that conceptualization for plurality depends primarily on the semantic class of the base word. We compare the two models on the basis of how well the speech signal of plural tokens in a large corpus of spoken American English aligns with the semantic vectors predicted by the two models. Two measures are employed: the performance of a form-to-meaning mapping and the correlations between form distances and meaning distances. Results converge on a superior alignment for CCA. Our results suggest that usage-based approaches to pluralization in which a given word’s own semantic neighborhood is given priority outperform theories according to which pluralization is conceptualized as a process building on high-level abstraction. We see that what has often been conceived of as a highly abstract concept, [+plural], is better captured via a family of mid-level partial generalizations.","['Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen', 'Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg']",['Germany'],"['Uhrig P.', 'Shafaei-Bajestan E.', 'Baayen R.H.']","['Cosine Class Average', 'distributional semantics', 'FRACSS', 'plural semantics', 'sound-meaning mapping', 'spoken word recognition']",Mental Lexicon,John Benjamins Publishing Company,"['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Language and Linguistics', 'Linguistics and Language']","['SOCI', 'ARTS', 'NEUR']",Article,0,52.0,2023
An inquiry into the semantic transparency and productivity of German particle verbs and derivational affixation,"© 2023 John Benjamins.This study addresses the relation between morphological productivity and semantic transparency. Using distributional semantics, we compare German word formation using particles with derivational word formation. We observed that derivational suffixes, but not particles, tend to make strong independent semantic contributions to their carrier words. In two-dimensional t-SNE maps, complex words show clustering by affix, but not by particle. Furthermore, the semantic vectors of suffixed words are predictable from their base words with higher accuracy than is possible for particle verbs. For particle verbs, but not affixed verbs, semantic similarity within the set of complex words correlated negatively with the number of types. Furthermore, only for particle verbs, a greater number of observed types predicted a reduced probability of observing unseen types. We propose that particle verbs primarily serve the onomasiological function of labeling, resulting in relatively idiosyncratic semantic vectors. By contrast, words sharing derivational affixes form distinct clusters in semantic space while maintaining strong and consistent semantic relations with their base words. This enables these words to serve not only as labels, but also allows them to be used with an anaphoric function in discourse.",['Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen'],['Germany'],"['Stupak I.V.', 'Baayen R.H.']","['embeddings', 'German', 'particle verbs', 'productivity', 'semantic transparency', 'suffixation']",Mental Lexicon,John Benjamins Publishing Company,"['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Language and Linguistics', 'Linguistics and Language']","['SOCI', 'ARTS', 'NEUR']",Article,0,47.0,2023
Paradigm gaps are associated with weird “distributional semantics” properties: Russian defective nouns and their case and number paradigms,"© 2023 John Benjamins Publishing Company.This study investigates the phenomenon of defectiveness in Russian case and number noun paradigms from the perspective of distributional semantics. We made use of word embeddings, high-dimensional vectors trained from large text corpora, and compared the observed paradigms of nouns that are defective in the genitive plural, as suggested by Zaliznjak (1977), with the observed paradigms for non-defective nouns. When the embeddings of about 20,000 inflected forms were projected onto a two-dimensional space, clusters of case and number within case were found, suggesting global semantic similarity for words with the same inflectional features. Moreover, defective lexemes were characterized by lower semantic transparency, in that inflected forms of the same lexeme are semantically less similar to each other, and their meanings are also more idiosyncratic. Furthermore, compared to non-defective lexemes, inflected forms from defective lexemes are further away from the idealized average case-number meanings, obtained by averaging over the vectors of all inflected forms of the same case-number combination. As a consequence, the semantics of defective forms are predicted less precisely by a simple model of conceptualization that assumes that the meaning of a given Russian inflected form is approximated well by the sum of pertinent embeddings of the lexeme, case, and number within case.

Productivity and semantic transparency An exploration of word formation in Mandarin Chinese,"© 2023 John Benjamins.We used word embeddings to study the relation between productivity and semantic transparency. We compiled a dataset with around 2700 two-syllable compounds that shared position-specific constituents (henceforth pivots) and some 1100 suffixed words. For each pivot and suffix, we calculated measures of productivity as well as measures of semantic transparency. For compounds, productivity (P) was negatively correlated with the number of types (V) and with the semantic similarity between non-pivot constituents and their compounds. Conversely, the greater semantic similarity of the pivot with either the compound or the non-pivot constituent predicted higher degrees of productivity. Visualization with t-SNE revealed clustering of suffixed words’ embeddings, but no by-pivot clustering for compounds, except for a minority of pivots whose regions in semantic space did not contain intruding unrelated compounds. A subset of these pivots was found to realize a fixed shift in semantic space from the base word to the corresponding compound, a property that also emerged for several suffixes. For these pivots, no correlation between P and V was present. Thus, Mandarin compounds appear to realize, at one extreme, motivated but unsystematic concept formation (where other pivots could just as well have been used), and at the other extreme, systematic suffix-like semantics.","['Northwest University', 'Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen']","['China', 'Germany']","['Tian S.', 'Baayen R.H.']","['distributional semantics', 'Mandarin compounding and affixation', 'morphological productivity', 'semantic transparency']",Mental Lexicon,John Benjamins Publishing Company,"['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Language and Linguistics', 'Linguistics and Language']","['SOCI', 'ARTS', 'NEUR']",Article,1,20.0,2023

A generating model for Finnish nominal inflection using distributional semantics,"© 2023 John Benjamins Publishing Company.Finnish nouns are characterized by rich inflectional variation, with obligatory marking of case and number, with optional possessive suffixes and with the possibility of further cliticization. We present a model for the conceptualization of Finnish inflected nouns, using pre-compiled fasttext embeddings (300-dimensional semantic vectors that approximate words’ meanings). Instead of deriving the semantic vector of an inflected word from another word in its paradigm, we propose that an inflected word is conceptualized by means of summation of latent vectors representing the meanings of its lexeme and its inflectional features. We tested this model on the 2,000 most frequent Finnish nouns and their inflected word forms from a corpus of Finnish (84 million tokens). Visualization of the semantic space of Finnish using t-SNE clarified that a ‘main effects’ additive model does not do justice to the semantics of inflection. In Finnish, how number is realized turns out to vary substantially with case. Further interactions emerged with the possessive suffixes and the clitics. By taking these interactions into account, the accuracy of our model, evaluated with the fasttext embeddings as gold standard, improved from 76% to 89%. Analyses of the errors made by the model clarified that 7.5% of errors are due to overabundance (and hence not true errors), and that 16.5% of the errors involved exchanges of semantically highly similar stems (lexemes). Our results indicate, first, that the semantics of Finnish noun inflection are more intricate than assumed thus far, and second, that these intricacies can be captured with surprisingly high accuracy by a simple generating model based on imputed semantic vectors for lexemes, inflectional features, and interactions of inflectional features.","['Itä-Suomen yliopisto', 'Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen']","['Finland', 'Germany']","['Chuang Y.-Y.', 'Baayen R.H.', 'Nikolaev A.']","['fasttext', 'Finnish language', 'imputed semantic vectors', 'inflectional morphology', 'tSNE', 'word embeddings', 'word2vec']",Mental Lexicon,John Benjamins Publishing Company,"['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Language and Linguistics', 'Linguistics and Language']","['SOCI', 'ARTS', 'NEUR']",Article,2,34.0,2023
FINANCIAL MATTERS AFFECTING MOZAMBICAN PROFESSIONAL TRANSLATORS AND INTERPRETERS: A SURVEY,"© 2022, University of Porto Faculty of Arts and Humanities. All rights reserved.This study investigates the financial challenges affecting translators and interpreters in Mozambique. Specifically, the study seeks to describe the Mozambican translators’ and interpreters’ business context. By means of a survey questionnaire, qualitative and quantitative data was collected from 42 participants. Data analysis led to the conclusion that Mozambican translators and interpreters are relatively young adults, who mostly offer freelance services on a part-time basis while holding a full-time job elsewhere, and that few of them have a pension scheme. It also identifies two distinct levels of income amongst these professionals. These findings highlight the need to equip translation and interpreting students with skills beyond their field of expertise to enhance graduate employability.",['Universidade Eduardo Mondlane'],['Mozambique'],['Magaia A.'],"['Financial Security', 'Translation and Interpreting', 'Translation and Interpreting Service Provision', 'Translator and Interpreter Training', 'Translators and Interpreters']",Translation Matters,University of Porto Faculty of Arts and Humanities,"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Language and Linguistics', 'Linguistics and Language']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,13.0,2022
Sexual Violence in Armed Conflict in Nigeria: International Law and Domestic Law at the Crossroads,"© 2022, Eotvos Lorand Tudomanyegyetem. All rights reserved.This study examines sexual violence in armed conflict, using the Boko-Haram insurgency as a case study. It explores the extent of protection accorded to victims of the conflict and the accountability of perpetrators under Nigerian law. It examines the State’s complicity in consistently allowing civilians to be targets of sexual violence while members of the Boko-Haram armed group who perpetrated such offenses continue to enjoy almost complete immunity. This study also investigates the legal hurdles hampering bringing perpetrators of sexual violence in armed conflict to justice and has provided solutions to the absence of legal protection for victims of sexual violence in armed conflict and the dearth of accountability for its perpetrators. It argues that the current legislation in place in Nigeria to combat sexual violence is grossly inadequate. not just for peacetime but in armed conflict, and the non-domestication of international treaties, particularly the Four Geneva Conventions and its Additional Protocols, has contributed to the near-complete impunity of perpetrators of sexual violence in armed conflict.",['Babcock University'],['Nigeria'],"['Olomojobi Y.', 'Oga J.']","['armed conflict', 'Boko-Haram insurgency', 'perpetrators', 'sexual violence', 'victims']",ELTE Law Journal,Eotvos Lorand Tudomanyegyetem,['Law'],['SOCI'],Article,0,,2022
An Eye For An Eye? The European Commission’s Proposal for an Anti-Coercion Instrument and What It Means for Member States,"© 2022, Eotvos Lorand Tudomanyegyetem. All rights reserved.The European Commission proposed a Regulation for an Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI) at the end of 2021, which is the latest example of a protectionist-style shift in EU Trade Policy. The ACI would grant the Commission strong competences to impose economic countermeasures, similar in their scope and effect to the existing sanctions under the Common Foreign and Security Policy. However, as the ACI is to be placed under the Common Commercial Policy, these economic sanctions would be adopted by only qualified majority voting, therefore effectively circumventing the unanimity rule in the European Council when it comes to sanctioning third countries and their legal persons.

The Interrelation between Privacy and Competition Law with Special Regard to the Obligations under the Digital Markets Act,"© 2022, Eotvos Lorand Tudomanyegyetem. All rights reserved.The study analyses the relationship between privacy and competition law, with a particular focus on digital platforms. Digital technology is the fundamental backbone of all sectors of the modern economy. The digital platform economy is characterised by the dominance of large tech giants, acting as gatekeepers in the digital market for business users and end-users of certain products and services. Accordingly, the paper seeks to illustrate some of the regulatory efforts and the necessary link between privacy and competition law in digital markets by focusing on the failures and problems of the digital marketplace. Thus, the article first provides a brief overview of the role of data in competition law assessments. Then, the study proceeds to introduce the regulatory concept of the Digital Markets Act. Finally, the article analyses the privacy-relevant obligations of the Digital Markets Act, comparing the European Commission’s original proposal and the regulatory standpoints of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.",['Vodafone Intelligent Solutions'],['Hungary'],['Maka Z.'],"['competition law', 'Digital Markets Act', 'digital platforms', 'privacy']",ELTE Law Journal,Eotvos Lorand Tudomanyegyetem,['Law'],['SOCI'],Article,0,,2022
European Payments in the Digital Age,"© 2022, Eotvos Lorand Tudomanyegyetem. All rights reserved.As long as there are online users, secure and fast electronic payments are essential. More recently, the pandemic has also accelerated the digitalisation of payments and changed the general view of e-payment systems, not only in the EU but around the world. Consumers fear the risk of virus transmission and government directives to increase the number of non-cash payments have together resulted in a decrease in the amount of cash as a form of payment. At the same time, commercial entities in the private sector proceeded to issue new types of private digital currencies; stablecoins, in addition to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The decline of cash and the rise of new private digital currencies has pushed public authorities, especially central banks, to look for other alternatives, such as issuing new public central digital currencies. In order to increase the supply of payment services and provide the public with a different money delivery option as a result of changing payment habits, central banks around the world believe that issuing a central bank digital currency is increasingly likely. Like other regions, the Eurozone is no exception in terms of launching and testing its digital currency, the digital euro. The main concern is whether the Eurozone is ready to use this type of currency – whether technically or legally – and whether the digital euro will be used by consumers as the next form of payment.",['Szegedi Tudományegyetem (SZTE)'],['Hungary'],['Miriyeva N.'],"['CBDC', 'digital currency', 'digital euro', 'digitalisation', 'e-payments']",ELTE Law Journal,Eotvos Lorand Tudomanyegyetem,['Law'],['SOCI'],Article,0,,2022

The Actualization of the Concept of National Fiqh in Building Religious Moderation in Indonesia Aktualisasi Konsep Fikih Kebangsaan dalam Membangun Moderasi Beragama di Indonesia,"© 2022, Program Studi Ilmu Agama Islam Program Magister, Universitas Islam Indonesia. All rights reserved.This study intends to critically examine and analyze the process of national fiqh actualization in shaping an attitude of religious moderation. Bearing in mind, the problem of unity amidst differences is primary, so it must remain a serious concern to maintain the country’s resilience. The research method was qualitative with a library research approach, which collected a variety of relevant literature according to the topic of study. This study concludes that the concept of national fiqh has an orientation to unity and integrity in maintaining national sovereignty wrapped with nationalism. National fiqh’s relevance and religious moderation become a mutually reinforcing synergy because national fiqh seeks to build a nationalist humanistic paradigm to reduce differences. Then, the actualization of national fiqh in building Indonesia’s religious moderation is the appreciation of the teachings of Islam in a complex and contextualist manner, not merely normative or dogmatic, strengthened by the process of cultivating moderate, fair, tolerant, humanist, ethical, religious, and nationalist attitudes.","['Institut Agama Islam Negeri Padangsidimpuan', 'Universitas Dinamika']",['Indonesia'],"['Lubis M.A.', 'Kurniawan P.', 'Rasyid A.', 'Muvid M.B.']","['actualization', 'Indonesia', 'National jurisprudence', 'religious moderation']",Millah: Journal of Religious Studies,"Program Studi Ilmu Agama Islam Program Magister, Universitas Islam Indonesia",['Religious Studies'],['ARTS'],Article,0,81.0,2022

All rights reserved.Although previous studies on usury have been conducted, the focus on customers’ knowledge of usury was limited. This study aimed to analyze Islamic bank customers’ cognitive process regarding usury and to analyze the differences between Muslim and non-Muslim customers’ perspectives regarding usury practice in the bank. The study could be categorized as qualitative because it used qualitative data in the form of interview results. Furthermore, it used a case study approach with Bank Syariah Indonesia Manado as the location. Twenty customers of the bank, ten of them Muslims and ten other non-Muslims, were selected as participants using a convenience sampling method. They were interviewed using the Zoom application to collect data on their knowledge regarding usury and Islamic banks. Anderson and Krathwohl’s categories of the cognitive process were used to categorize participants’ responses. The results showed that all customers attained level 1 (remember) and level 2 (understand) usury and only four of them attained level 3 (apply) based on Anderson and Krathwohl’s categorization. It implied that only four of ten Muslim participants become customers of the Islamic bank because of their belief in the bank’s status as a usury-free financial institution. Other findings suggested that all customers were in the same opinion that money lending practiced by the loan sharks should be categorized as usury, while not all customers viewed money lending by the current banking industry as usury.","['Institut Agama Islam Negeri Manado', 'The University of Sydney']","['Indonesia', 'Australia']","['Samad T.F.D.', 'Saifulloh A.']","['Bank Syariah Indonesia', 'Muslim Customer', 'Non-Muslim Customer', 'Usury']",Millah: Journal of Religious Studies,"Program Studi Ilmu Agama Islam Program Magister, Universitas Islam Indonesia",['Religious Studies'],['ARTS'],Article,0,26.0,2022
Learning Taxonomy of Islamic Education: The Development of Aql and the Brain in Quran from a Neuroscience Perspective Taksonomi Pembelajaran dalam Pendidikan Islam: Pengembangan Akal dan Otak dalam Al-Qur'an dari Perspektif Neurosains,"© 2022, Program Studi Ilmu Agama Islam Program Magister, Universitas Islam Indonesia. All rights reserved.The hierarchical thinking concept in the Islamic education field is based on theological and philosophical beliefs. Up to now, this concept is not yet proven scientifically and neurobiologically. As a result, Islamic education does not yet have a learning taxonomy that accommodates the effective and spiritual aspects of developing students' intellectual potential. Consequently, it forced its system to apply Bloom’s taxonomy which focuses only on the cognitive part. With the rising of new theories, especially neuro-theology, neuro-philosophy, and neuro-education, emerge the opportunities to connect hierarchical thinking in Islamic education with these three theories. This research aims to compile a learning taxonomy of Islamic education based on neuroscience, accommodating the emotional, intellectual, and spiritual aspects. This research is a systematic review, which integrates, interprets, and synthesizes the hierarchical thinking concept with neuro-theology, neuro-philosophy, and neuro-education. The result shows that hierarchical thinking in Islamic education has neuro-physiological with six brain components: temporal lobe, parietal association cortex-temporal-occipital, limbic system, cingulate gyrus, prefrontal context, and prefrontal association cortex. These six components of the brain have relevance to hierarchical thinking and bloom taxonomy, namely remember (dzikir), understand (nazhr), apply (‘ilm-amal), evaluate (muhasabah); analyze (fikr), and create (ijtihad). Thus, the brain's six components and hierarchical thinking can be narratively synthesized into a learning taxonomy of Islamic education. In the future, this finding could become theoretical discourse because hierarchical thinking, neuro-theology, neuro-philosophy, and neuro-education emerge the further development of learning taxonomy in Islamic education.",['Universitas Ahmad Dahlan'],['Indonesia'],['Suyadi'],"['Hierarchical thinking', 'Islamic education', 'learning taxonomy', 'neuroscience']",Millah: Journal of Religious Studies,"Program Studi Ilmu Agama Islam Program Magister, Universitas Islam Indonesia",['Religious Studies'],['ARTS'],Article,1,91.0,2022
USE OF PHOTOVOLTAIC PANELS IN RESIDENCES AS A SOURCE OF PRIMARY ELECTRICITY GENERATION,"© 2022 by authors and Galileo Institute of Technology and Education of the Amazon (ITEGAM).Population growth at a global level implies an increase in energy consumption by the population. This increase is expected in urban agglomerations composed of residences. The production of energy in the residential area has been discussed when talking about self-sufficiency and clean and sustainable energy. An aggravating factor in the context of forms of energy generation is the great impact of burning fossil fuels that release polluting gases when producing electricity. The present study sought to discuss, based on the literature, the use of photovoltaic panels in the generation of clean energy in homes as an alternative to conventional means. Therefore, the methodology used was based on the search for scientific studies in databases about the proposed theme. A bibliographic survey was carried out in order to obtain studies that would support the research. Studies in the databases Periódicos CAPES, Scholar Google and Scopus were found and selected based on certain criteria. Therefore, it was found that the use of photovoltaic panels in the generation of energy for homes is promising in reducing other energy sources. Several studies show the viability of this type of energy in homes in Brazil, which has a large availability of daily sunlight for its operation. However, the technology in question still has a high implementation cost, which may decrease with government incentives and a decrease in the values of its components. In addition, the use of solar energy compared to conventional means of energy generation has a compensatory value with its long-term use.",['UNINORTE'],['Brazil'],"['Correa E.A.R.', 'da Rocha C.C.G.', 'Campos P.S.']","['Cost', 'Photovoltaic panels', 'Power supply', 'Residences', 'Solar energy']",Journal of Engineering and Technology for Industrial Applications,Galileo Institute of Technology and Education of the Amazon (ITEGAM),"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","['ENGI', 'COMP']",Article,0,45.0,2022

This is a device in which it is possible to register the clock-in and clock-out schedules, and in addition, it is possible to check the overtime report where the sector supervisor can offer these hours as days off. Given the deficiencies found in the sector, one being the frequency control that was still being done manually and the other, the high demand for work with the need to work overtime, the theme was developed. The importance of the system is that it makes the dynamics of the working day more automated and optimized. In its creation, the methodology of research, interviews, and data collection was adopted, as well as technological tools such as Biometrics, Programming Language, and Database. After the development and tests, it was possible to implement the electronic time clock in the sector.

OFF-GRID MOBILE PHONE CHARGING SYSTEMS FOR RURAL ENERGY NEEDS,"© 2022 by authors and Galileo Institute of Technology and Education of the Amazon (ITEGAM).For several decades, rural electrification has remained a formidable challenge, particularly in Nigeria. Financial constraints, difficult rural terrain, inefficient policy, and a lack of industrial community development have all contributed to the grid expansion problem in these areas. These areas are energy-deficient, and their energy demands to keep up with cutting-edge communication technology are constantly rising. As a result, rural areas are confronted with the issue of charging. Consequently, many rural residents are forced to rely on diesel/petrol generators or travel long distances and pay a premium to have their mobile phones charged. Thus, this paper proposes an off-grid solar-powered charging system as an alternative, sustainable solution to meet rural mobile phone energy demand. The methodology employed six-tier architectural features, with the economic comparison metric based on net present value and payback period. Furthermore, the proposed model's performance analysis revealed that the charging rate is dependent on the phone battery type and charger type. Furthermore, the off-grid mobile charging system has a higher net present value ($20,658US) and a shorter payback period of 2.5 years than the alternative investment of a gasolne generator.","['Olabisi Onabanjo University', 'University of Lagos']",['Nigeria'],"['Osifeko M.', 'Okandeji A.A.', 'Okubanjo A.A.']","['Charging System', 'Energy Demand', 'Example five', 'Mobile Phone', 'Off-grid']",Journal of Engineering and Technology for Industrial Applications,Galileo Institute of Technology and Education of the Amazon (ITEGAM),"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","['ENGI', 'COMP']",Article,0,23.0,2022
COP27 Climate Change Conference: urgent action needed for Africa and the world,"© 2022 Zielinski C.The 2022 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) paints a dark picture of the future of life on earth, characterized by ecosystem collapse, species extinction, and climate hazards such as heatwaves and floods (1). These are all linked to physical and mental health problems, with direct and indirect consequences of increased morbidity and mortality. To avoid these catastrophic health effects across all regions of the globe, there is broad agreement—as 231 health journals argued together in 2021—that the rise in global temperature must be limited to less than 1.5oC compared with pre-industrial levels. While the Paris Agreement of 2015 outlines a global action framework that incorporates providing climate finance to developing countries, this support has yet to materialize (2). COP27 is the fifth Conference of the Parties (COP) to be organized in Africa since its inception in 1995.

The Associations between Accelerometer-measured Physical Activity and Cardiometabolic Disease Risk Factors and Metabolic Syndrome in Korean Adults: Results from 2014-2016 KNHANES DATA,"© Korea Institute of Sport Science.PURPOSE This study aimed to examine the associations between accelerometer-measured physical activity and both cardiometabolic disease risk factors and metabolic syndrome in Korean adults. METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study with age-sex matched case-control using data from the 2014-2016 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which was administered to South Korean adults (n=320). Individuals were categorized into quartiles based on accelerometer-measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Demographic and physical characteristics, waist circumference, visceral adiposity index, blood pressure, lipid profiles, and TG/HDL-C were observed. The associations between MVPA status and cardiometabolic disease risk factors as well as metabolic syndrome were determined using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS For the waist circumference, SBP, DBP, MBP, visceral adiposity, triglyceride, and a surrogate estimate of insulin resistance, the Q1 and Q2 groups had higher means compared with the Q3 and Q4 groups. HDL-C was higher in the Q3 and Q4 groups compared to the Q1 and Q2 groups. Odds ratios for cardiometabolic disease risk factors and metabolic syndrome decreased in a curvilinear manner with the increasing quartile of MVPA. CONCLUSIONS Adults with higher MVPA participation were strongly associated with cardiometabolic disease risk factors and metabolic syndrome.","['Syracuse University', 'Kyung Hee University']","['South Korea', 'United States']","['Lee J.-M.', 'Kim J.Y.', 'Jung H.C.', 'Seo M.-W.', 'Song J.K.']","['Accelerometer', 'Cardiometabolic health', 'KNHNES', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Physical activity']",Korean Journal of Sport Science,Korea Institute of Sport Science,"['Orthopedics and Sports Medicine', 'Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health']","['MEDI', 'HEAL']",Article,0,71.0,2014
Insights into the clinical profile and comorbidities of Factitious Disorder in a multispecialty setting in southwest Nigeria: A cases series and review,"© BUMJ.Background: Factitious disorder (FD) is an under-recognized and under-diagnosed mental condition. Healthcare professionals often have challenges to diagnose and treating the disorder. As a result, needless and endless medical resources are recommended to assess and evaluate those affected. FD may present as a physical condition, a psychological disorder, or maybe both depending on the prominent symptoms. However, there is a strong correlation between having FD and psychiatric symptoms. Main Text: FD occurs in early adulthood, with a mean age of onset of 25 years in both genders, although with differing demographic features. The lifetime prevalence of FD imposed on oneself in clinical settings is 1.0%, 0.1% in the overall population (ranging between 0.007% and 8.0%) and occurs more in female health care professionals. FD may make up 0.6%–3.0% of psychiatric referrals, and it accounts for 3-5% of doctor-patient contacts. In actuality, 1-2% of hospital admissions and an average of 6-8% of all psychiatric admissions have been underreported. The study aimed to highlight the signs and symptoms of FD identified in a psychiatry department of a multispecialty center and to increase the awareness of health practitioners. A critical review of the literature was done with an emphasis on psychological symptoms. PubMed, Mendeley, and Google Scholar were thoroughly searched and full-text publications of journals from 2010-2021 were included. Conclusion: FD is a diagnostic puzzle that necessitates adequate, prompt medical attention as well as social support because of the potentially fatal consequence. A stronger patient-therapist relationship can strengthen the patient's conscious self-control to minimize the symptoms; therefore the healthcare provider has to be open-minded. For the diagnostic enigma to be removed and for ease of treatment, additional research, increasing awareness among medical professionals and the general public, accurate evaluation, diagnosis, and psychotherapy should be encouraged. These case studies will contribute to the knowledge base of FD and improve the quality of care.",['Babcock University'],['Nigeria'],"['Awokoya E.T.', 'Fasesan O.A.']","['Factitious disorder', 'fictitious disorder', 'Malingering', 'mental disorders', 'Munchausen’s Syndrome', 'psychiatric disorder', 'Simulated disorder']",Babcock University Medical Journal,Babcock Medical Society,['Medicine (all)'],['MEDI'],Review,0,66.0,2010
"The use of improvised negative pressure therapy to manage wounds in difficult situations at LAUTECH Teaching Hospital, Ogbomoso: a case series","© BUMJ. 2022 Open Access.Background Creating an airtight seal is vital in making a Negative pressure wound therapy setup functional and effective but in some conditions, this may be difficult to achieve. Case presentation We present the methods of use of improvised negative pressure therapy in the difficult settings of external fixation and complete scotch cast with a window for wound dressing in two patients managed at LAUTECH Teaching Hospital, Ogbomoso. The simple use of opsite initially over the foam dressing and reinforcing it with cling film and subsequently wrapping strips of opsite around the pin sites and the potential leak sites as described in this report is very effective and with lower cost when compared with other methods.

Nigerian undergraduate students’ perception towards COVID-19 prevention: Implications for policy,"© BUMJ.Objective: Universities provide a supportive and safe learning environment for students. To limit the transmission of COVID-19, the WHO has recommended several preventive measures including frequent washing of hands, hand sanitizer usage, the wearing of masks, social distancing, covering of mouth while sneezing, etc. Students need to comply with these personal hygiene practices to limit the transmission of COVID-19. Methodology: A descriptive cross-sectional study design was used to assess the knowledge and practice of COVID-19 prevention among undergraduate students of Babcock University, Ilishan-Remo Ogun State, Nigeria. 430 respondents were selected using a multistage sampling technique. Data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows Version 21. A p-value of < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. Results: 98.8%, 96.4%, and 84.1% of the respondents knew about COVID-19, know that it is a contagious disease, and know that a virus causes COVID-19 respectively. 60.4% and 56.7% heard about COVID-19 from the news and social media and had good knowledge of COVID-19 respectively. 38.2%, 36.7%, and 63.3% of the respondents have an average level of practice of COVID-19 prevention, had been vaccinated majorly with AstraZeneca brand of vaccine (20.6%), and are yet to be vaccinated respectively. There is no association between the knowledge of the prevention of COVID-19 and practice among undergraduate students of Babcock University (0.258, χ2=5.300).

Ectopic breast tissue mimicking Bartholin’s Abscess: a case report,"© BUMJ. 2022.Background: Ectopic breast tissue (EBT) is an uncommon occurrence in which the breast tissue can be found at any point along the milk line. Although it is most commonly found on the axilla, it can also present on the thighs, perineum, vulva, inframammary region, and groin. EBT mimicking a Bartholin’s abscess is extremely rare. Case presentation: Here, we report the case of a 31-year-old nulliparous woman who presented to our gynecology clinic with a complaint of right-sided vulvar swelling. An initial diagnosis of Bartholin’s abscess was made after clinical examination. This was surgically removed using marsupialization. However, following histopathological & immuno-histochemical evaluation, a confirmatory diagnosis of ectopic breast tissue was made. Conclusion: Indeed, our case re-emphasizes the absolute need for histopathological examination of every tumor notwithstanding the nature of the presentation, site of occurrence, and/or initial diagnosis. Furthermore, although rare, EBT should be considered an important differential in tumors of the vulva.",['Babcock University'],['Nigeria'],"['Okebalama V.C.', 'Nwadiokwu J.I.', 'Imaralu J.O.', 'Ehioghae O.', 'Solaja O.T.']","['Bartholin’s abscess', 'Ectopic breast tissue', 'Vulva']",Babcock University Medical Journal,Babcock Medical Society,['Medicine (all)'],['MEDI'],Article,0,13.0,2022
Contextualizing migration and mental health in the post-COVID era,"© BUMJ. 2020.Background: The population of migrants all over the world is progressively rising. The major reasons for migration include the desire for self-actualization, moving to a place with more opportunities, tourism, and education, and escaping hardship and political unrest in the home country. In recent times cli mate change, insecurity, and economic hardship are top of the list. The global economy has suffered a major blow from the multiple waves of the lingering COVID-19 pandemic. To lessen the scourge of inflation and to restore economic stability, several countries are being forced to liberalize their immigration policies and therefore immigrants are welcomed in these nations. This review attempts to investigate how migration in the post-pandemic era affects migrants' mental health. Main Text: Migration and the COVID-19 epidemic both have beneficial and durable effects on the mental health of migrants and immigration laws have a direct impact on several health-related issues. Mental health disorders may develop at any point from the pre-migration phase to the post-migration settlement in the host nations. Factors such as host community, racism, marginalization, political climate, poor support, loss of social status, language barriers, undocumented status, climate change, mode of dressing in the host country, and several others may lead to mental health disorders among migrants. Unfortunately, there is limited access to care, and the services provided may not be culturally sensitive. Conclusion: Despite the benefits gotten from migration like financial benefits and economic development of the native country and the left behind family members, migration has enormous psychological complications which have to be attended to. Access to specialists who are trained to provide culturally sensitive interventions and implement outreach programs to introduce the services to the migrants’ community should be encouraged.",['Babcock University'],['Nigeria'],['Fasesan O.A.'],"['Anxiety disorder', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Depression', 'Emigration', 'Immigration', 'Mental health', 'post-COVID', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Psychosis', 'Substance Use Disorder']",Babcock University Medical Journal,Babcock Medical Society,['Medicine (all)'],['MEDI'],Review,0,74.0,2020
Sport Brand Authenticity: Scale Development and Validation,"© Korea Institute of Sport Science.PURPOSE This study aimed to identify the dimensions of sport brand authenticity and to develop a valid and reliable scale for measuring such dimensions. METHODS Along with a sequential mixed method design, qualitative researches were conducted (a literature review on brand authenticity and the inherent value of sport, 5 one-to-one expert interviews, and a Delphi survey of 10 researchers). Based on the qualitative research results, an EFA (n=304), 2 times CFA (1st: n=304, 2nd: n=311), and correlation analysis using the other scale (brand relationship quality, brand attachment, brand credibility) were conducted to test reliability, construct validity, and criterion-related validity. RESULTS In the qualitative research results, 8 dimensions with 36 items were extracted; however 6 dimensions (originality, connectedness, legitimacy, authority, sport spirit, and expertise) with 28 items were identified as appropriate structures from EFA and CFA, and the relations between all the dimensions and other scales related to consumer attitude were statistically significant in the correlation analysis. CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest that the scale in this study could provide a new and specific perspective on sport brand authenticity, which is constructed using a general aspect and a sport specific aspect, and an understanding of the concept of sport brand authenticity in other sport industries.",['Seoul National University'],['South Korea'],"['Lee J.', 'Kang J.']","['Brand attachment', 'Brand authenticity', 'Brand credibility', 'Consumer brand relationship quality', 'Scale development', 'Sport brand authenticity', 'Sport industry', 'Sporting goods brand']",Korean Journal of Sport Science,Korea Institute of Sport Science,"['Orthopedics and Sports Medicine', 'Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health']","['MEDI', 'HEAL']",Article,0,56.0,2019
"The current use of the artemisinin-based Combination Therapies in adult patients at a Tertiary Hospital, South-South Nigeria","© BUMJ. 2022 Open Access.Objective: The antimalarial preferences, tolerability, and cost of the Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) among adult patients and caregivers are largely understudied despite being the recommended treatment for Plasmodium falciparum. We, therefore, evaluated antimalarial preferences, tolerability, and cost of the ACTs among adult patients attending the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Nigeria. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted among adult patients and their caregivers at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Nigeria, using a semi-structured questionnaire. Their preferred antimalarial medication, previous use of antimalarial monotherapies, current ACT use; cost considerations, and adverse effects profile were sought. Result: Six hundred respondents were recruited with a mean age of 41.4±16.3years and M/F ratio of 1.4. The majority (88.0 %), reported that they had between 1-5 episodes of malaria fever in a year. Only 28.2% received doctors’ prescriptions while 85.8% purchased their antimalarial medications from a pharmacy. Sixty percent of the respondents used at least one ACT; mainly Artemether-Lumefantrine (AL) 312 (52.0%). Only 9.3% reported previous adverse effects with the ACTs with 4.0% of respondents discontinuing their medications. The mean (SD) cost of purchasing ACTs was 1,516.47±760.3 (3.65 USD) Naira. Conclusion: This study showed adult patients’ preference for the ACTs, especially Artemether-Lumefantrine despite some inclination towards antimalarial monotherapies and parenteral route. There was also a high rate of use of malaria presumptive treatment, but only a few reported adverse effects. There is a need to make ACTs affordable because the cost is still presently high for most Nigerians.",['University of Benin'],['Nigeria'],"['Ayinbuomwan S.A.', 'Opadeyi A.O.', 'Isah A.O.']","['Adult', 'Antimalarial', 'Artemisinin', 'Malaria', 'Nigeria']",Babcock University Medical Journal,Babcock Medical Society,['Medicine (all)'],['MEDI'],Article,0,39.0,2022
"Baseline anthropometric measurements and Obesity among students in Sagamu, Ogun State, southwest, Nigeria","© BUMJ.Objectives: This study was designed to determine the anthropometric characteristics and prevalence of obesity among secondary and undergraduate students in Sagamu. Methods: This cross-sectional study involved a selection of 260 students aged 10 to 33 years in Sagamu using a convenience sampling method. The weight, height, and waist and hip circumferences of each subject were measured. The body mass index was then calculated.

Knowledge of the National Health Act among Physicians in two Tertiary Hospitals in Southern Nigeria,"© BUMJ. 2022 Open Access.Objective: Knowledge of provisions of the National Health Act among physicians and stakeholders is pivotal to its successful implementation. This study aimed to assess the knowledge of the National Health Act (NHA) among Physicians in two tertiary hospitals in Nigeria. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in two tertiary hospitals in Southern Nigeria. The consecutively recruited eligible respondents were assessed for knowledge of NHA using a 24-item self-administered close-ended structured questionnaire. The total obtainable score was 26. Those with <13 points had poor knowledge, 13-21 points had good knowledge and >21 points had excellent knowledge. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21 software. P-value of < 0.05 was taken as significant. Results: One hundred and ninety-five doctors with a male: female ratio of 1.9:1 participated in the study. The majority (91.8%) were ≤40 years and 129(66.2%) of the participants were ≤ 10 years post qualification. The frequency of correctly answered questions ranged between 7.7%-89.2%. According to overall knowledge scores; 64.6% had poor knowledge; 35.4% had good knowledge and none had excellent scores. There was no statistically significant association between knowledge of NHA and gender, age, and number of years post-qualification (p > 0.05). Conclusion: This study showed that only about a third of the participants had good knowledge of key provisions of the NHA.

Demographic and fertility transition in Nigeria; the progress made so far: a literature review,"© BUMJ. 2022 Open Access.Background: Nigeria, since its inception as a sovereign nation, has been plagued by population explosion. This may be due to factors that need to be addressed by the government and individuals alike such as fertility desires. Main body: In the course of this review, we drew our resource information from the Nigerian Demographic and Health survey of 2018, PubMed, and African Journals Online (AJOL, Scholarly publications on sub-Saharan Africa and Nigeria in particular that dwell on the area under review. The total fertility rate (TFR) meaning the number of children a woman would bear in her lifetime is high, at a rate of 5.3 Children per woman. Population explosion is also a consequence of the low contraceptive use in Nigeria which stands at a rate of 17 % amongst married couples. Other factors that could be responsible for this population explosion include a lack of good population policies and few or non-existent national family planning programs. These negative effects on the Nigerian population made it grow at an annual rate of 2 %. Fifty percent (50%) of the Nigerian age distribution is under 19 years. This means that the Nigerian demography may not transit (change) readily. Conclusion: A community or country is said to undergo demographic transition when the death rate and fertility rate balance each other, and the age distribution is made of working-class people against the young and the aged who are dependent on others for a living. The economy of such a country is industrialized, with good health systems and a long life span for its citizens. Fertility transition on the other hand means a situation where a community or national fertility rate shows a substantial decline compared to industrialized countries of Europe, The USA, and Latin America in the contemporary world.",['Niger Delta University'],['Nigeria'],"['Addah A.O.', 'Ikobho E.H.']","['contraceptive prevalence', 'Demographic transition', 'Fertility transition', 'Nigeria Population policies']",Babcock University Medical Journal,Babcock Medical Society,['Medicine (all)'],['MEDI'],Review,0,30.0,2022
A QE Study on Golf Putting,"© Korea Institute of Sport Science.PURPOSE The quiet eye (QE) is defined as the final fixation time that is a specific target prior to initiating movement. This study aimed to identify the cause of QE in golf putting and to present an efficient practice method for improving putting skills. METHODS Thirty participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Each group practiced golf putting in different ways for two days. RESULTS The QE group showed a significant difference in putting scores, which was higher than that of the control group. The visual-occlusion group showed no difference compared to the other groups in terms of putting scores. The QE group showed a significant difference in terms of QE in the retention and competition tests compared to the pretest. The control group tended to have a slightly longer QE in competition tests compared to the pretest. The visual-occlusion group showed no statistically significant difference in QE based on the period. All three groups had significantly longer swing times over the selected period. There was no significant difference in terms of the alpha power of the occipital lobe based on group and period. CONCLUSIONS The position of the visual-occlusion group became stable. However, the QE did not lengthen. The QE group had a longer QE. Furthermore, the control group that practiced with their eyes open tended to have longer QE. Therefore, QE may be related to visual-based cognitive processing rather than postural-kinematics. Finally, this study proved that QE practice is a more efficient method for novices in golf putting.",['Jeonbuk National University'],['South Korea'],"['Han D.-W.', 'Song S.-H.']","['Alpha power', 'Golf putting', 'Quiet Eye', 'Visual-occlusion']",Korean Journal of Sport Science,Korea Institute of Sport Science,"['Orthopedics and Sports Medicine', 'Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health']","['MEDI', 'HEAL']",Article,0,60.0,2019
Allele Frequencies of Apolipoprotein E in a South Western Nigerian population on HAART,"© BUMJ.Objective: Increasing evidence has shown that ApoE polymorphism is associated with the early onset of cardiovascular and neurological diseases in patients on HAART. The frequency of occurrence of the alleles and the genotypes vary by race and population. The study describes the pattern seen among adults i n Ibadan, Nigeria. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 124 randomly selected HIV-infected persons on protease inhibitor therapy who receive care at the adult antiretroviral clinic of the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan. DNA was extracted from leucocytes using EDTA blood. ApoE genotypes were determined using the Seeplex ApoE ACE genotyping kit. The epidemiological distribution of apoE is figured with a pie graph. Results: About four-fifth (79%) of the participants were females while about two-thirds (68%) were below 50 years of age. The most frequently occurring allele was the ε3 allele (82.2%) and the most common ApoE genotype observed was ε3/ε3. This genotype was present in 52 (41.9%) of the participants. At least one allele of Apo ε2, Apo ε3, and Apo ε4 was present in 28(22.5%), 102 (82.2%), and 50 (40.3) of the study participants respectively. Homozygosity for Apo ε2 and Apo ε4 was observed in 4.8% and 8.0% of participants respectively. Conclusions: Allelic frequency seen is similar to that described in other studied populations and the frequency of genotypes observed was also similar to those described among world populations with a higher observation of ApoE4 allele as seen in people of African descent.","['Babcock University', 'University College Hospital, Ibadan', 'LAUTECH Teaching Hospital', 'Clinix Healthcare']",['Nigeria'],"['Nduka N.', 'Bamidele O.T.', 'Kuti M.A.', 'Olaseinde O.', 'Akande J.O.', 'Olayanju O.', 'Eseile B.J.', 'Emuze M.']","['Allele', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'HAART']",Babcock University Medical Journal,Babcock Medical Society,['Medicine (all)'],['MEDI'],Article,0,25.0,2020

The role of spirituality and religiosity in psychoactive substance use among adolescents in a Nigerian Hospital,"© BUMJ. 2022.Objective: Adolescence is a transition period where drug experimentation is common. Spirituality and religiosity have been recognized by literature as having a possible role in stabilizing good physical and mental health. To compare the religiosity and spirituality among adolescents abusing a psychoactive substance and those not abusing psychoactive substances in a Nigerian hospital Methods: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study conducted among adolescent patients admitted to the drug rehabilitation unit and adolescents attending the General Outpatient Department of the ABUAD Multisystem Hospital, Ado-Ekiti. The Daily Spiritual Experience Scale and Centrality of Religiosity Scale were used Results: The prevalence of high religiosity and spirituality among the respondents was 57.9% and 56.1%. The prevalence of high religiosity and spirituality among respondents not abusing psychoactive substances was 62.9% and 62.6% respectively, while the level of high spirituality and religiosity among respondents abusing psychoactive substances was 53.0% and 49.1% respectively. A significant proportion of the respondents who had a low level of religiosity (55.9%) abused psychoactive substances than respondents who do not abuse psychoactive substances (45.7%) (X2 =7.694 p=0.006). Similarly, more proportion of respondents who had a low level of spirituality (57.4%) abused psychoactive substances than respondents who do not abuse psychoactive substances (44.2%). The observation is statistically significant (X2 =11.1, p<0.001). In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between the spirituality and religiosity scores among the respondents (r =0.50, p<0.001) Conclusion: Psychoactive drug use among the respondent was associated with both low religiosity and spirituality. Therefore, religious activities should be encouraged among adolescents.","['Osun State School of Nursing', 'Afe Babalola University']",['Nigeria'],"['Falade J.', 'Falade O.O.', 'Mustapha A.F.', 'Oyebanji A.H.']","['Adolescents', 'Psychoactive Substance Use', 'Religiosity', 'Spirituality']",Babcock University Medical Journal,Babcock Medical Society,['Medicine (all)'],['MEDI'],Article,0,62.0,2022
A countess as goat and a duke as boar: Animal stories as political commentary,"© John Benjamins Publishing Company.This article studies three medieval texts in which specific historical persons are presented as animals to comment upon their behaviour and on the situation they were in. The choice of representing animals is studied, as are the literary techniques and the meaning of the texts. It is argued that this meaning is always general, and older scholarly interpretations, that are more specific, are rejected. An explanation is suggested for the rarity of this type of 'animal story as political commentary', and it is argued that this type is fundamentally different from the passages in traditional animal stories which have previously been assumed also to contain veiled political commentary.",['Universiteit Utrecht'],['Netherlands'],['Wackers P.'],,Reinardus,John Benjamins Publishing Company,['Literature and Literary Theory'],['ARTS'],Article,0,68.0,
Mind the subtle f0 modifications: The interaction of tone and intonation in Sinitic varieties,"© 2022 The authors.Sinitic varieties are well known for their complex lexical tone systems. Lesser known is that these varieties also employ intonation for multiple communicative functions, ranging from indexing a speaker’s socio-cognitive information (such as emotions and attitudes) to signaling various linguistic information (such as asking questions, marking focus, and encoding prosodic structure). This paper reviews the multiplexing of lexical tone and intonation into the same melodic f0 signal. The main empirical focus is on Standard Chinese; whenever possible, comparisons are made across Sinitic varieties (such as Shanghai Wu Chinese and Cantonese). I will show that lexical tone constrains the changes of f0 for intonation. How tone and intonation interact, however, varies across communicative contexts and language varieties, which is also reflected in how listeners utilize the f0 information to decode the melodic pitch signal during speech processing. From a cross-linguistic viewpoint, findings on intonation in Sinitic varieties suggest 1) the need for detailed acoustic and perceptual studies to understand the subtle f0 modifications for intonation in tone languages, and 2) the importance of a comparative approach to understanding the similarities and differences of intonation in tone languages.",['Universiteit Leiden'],['Netherlands'],['Chen Y.'],"['Chinese', 'emotion and attitude', 'focus and question', 'prosodic structure', 'Sinitic languages', 'tone and intonation']",Stellenbosch Papers in Linguistics Plus,"Department of General Linguistics, Stellenbosch University","['Language and Linguistics', 'Linguistics and Language']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,124.0,2022
"Sedimentological characteristics and their relationship with landsliding in the Bhilangana Basin, Garhwal Himalaya, India Características sedimentológicas y su relación con los corrimientos de tierra en la cuenca de Bhilangana, Garhwal Himalaya, India","© 2022, Universidad Nacional de Colombia. All rights reserved.Every year during the Indian Summer Monsoon, large number of landslides occur in the Lesser and the Greater Himalayan rock formations, triggered by intense rainfall episodes coupled with physiography and anthropogenic activities. The present study investigates the slope failure mechanism’s relationship with slope material compositions. Hence, sediment samples of 25 landslides were collected along the road corridors. These samples were collected from the Lesser and Greater Himalayan ranges and rock formations. The sediment was collected from the active landslides to understand particle size, clay content, moisture content, mineral composition, crystallographic structures, and the influence of geomorphic processes on the landslide failure processes. The samples were analyzed using a sieve, X-ray Diffractometry (XRD), and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to accomplish the study’s objectives. The analysis indicates that the Lesser Himalayan meta-sedimentary rock formations have a high composition of fine and medium-size particles, lesser quartz mineral compositions with calcite, and a highly crushed and fractured presence, conchoidal fractures types of morphological features. Micrographs obtained from the schist and phyllite rock of the Lesser Himalayan origin shows highly sheared and crushing, crystal overgrowth; and, in turn, have a higher susceptibility to landslides. The relationship between slope materials and instability has shown a definite pattern in the study area. The debris flow and slump have a comparatively higher percentage of clay and silt compared to debris fall, debris slide, and rockfall. The particle size composition of sediment collected from the slip zone is significantly related to the types of landslides.

The aim of this work is to offer a new book-length commentary on the earliest of Seneca's extant writings, along with a revision of the Latin text and a reassessment of Seneca's intellectual program, strategies, and context. A crucial document to penetrate Seneca's discourse on the self in its embryonic stages, the Ad Marciam is here taken seriously as an engaging attempt to direct the persuasive power of literary models and rhetorical devices toward the fundamentally moral project of healing Marcia's grief and correcting her cognitive distortions. Through close reading of the Latin text, this commentary shows that Seneca invariably adapts different traditions and voices - from Greek consolations to Plato's dialogues, from the Roman discourse of gender and exemplarity to epic poetry - to a Stoic framework, so as to give his reader a lucid understanding of the limits of the self and the ineluctability of natural laws.",['Università degli Studi di Palermo'],['Italy'],['Tutrone F.'],"['Antiquity', 'Consolation literature', 'Emotions', 'L.

Integrated monolingualism and audism governing Spanish Sign-Language users’ self-determination in the legal system,"© 2023 John Benjamins.Many legal systems have begun to adjust their social and linguistic practices to accommodate non-dominant social groups. However, linguistic diversity is often framed as an exception, and interpreters are viewed as a service to address these exceptions rather than as part of broader structural changes to enable access to justice. This article explores the access to and participation in the Spanish legal system of Spanish Sign-Language users (SSLUs) who are deaf or heard of hearing. Through semi-structured interviews with SSLUs, the article elicits their perceptions of the legal field. These data are analyzed from the perspective of self-determination theory (Deci and Ryan 1985) to identify how SSLUs’ psychological needs of competence, autonomy, and relatedness are linked to the social, cultural, and economic capital invested and distributed through social practices. The goal is to clarify how SSLUs’ habitus sustains or resists monolingual and audist ideologies establishing hierarchies between language communities.","['Universidad Rey Juan Carlos', 'Universidad Jaume I']",['Spain'],"['Gonzalez-Montesino R.H.', 'Monzo-Nebot E.']","['audism', 'capital', 'habitus', 'monolingualism', 'self-determination theory', 'social practice']",Translation and Interpreting Studies,John Benjamins Publishing Company,"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Language and Linguistics', 'Linguistics and Language']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,71.0,2023
‘Help is on the way’: (In)accessible policing in the UK through sign language interpreting,"© 2023 John Benjamins Publishing Company.In the UK, police reforms to meet needs of a diverse society have been limited in the case of deaf signers to an increase in sign language interpreting services (SLIS). This article explores the consequences of this dependence on SLIS by the UK police. We consider how deaf signers’ contact with the police may be inaccessible, despite national frameworks that ‘guarantee’ accessibility through the provision of BSL-English interpreting. We draw on qualitative data from focus groups and interviews with police officers and custody sergeants who describe their experiences of having contact with deaf signers (or other minority language users) through interpreters. We examine and contrast their perceptions and experiences concerning if, when, and how SLIS provided access, as well as its impact on their contact with deaf signers. We compare these findings with UK police reform policies to identify the current state of these provisions along with potential divergences.",['Heriot-Watt University'],['United Kingdom'],"['Skinner R.', 'Napier J.']","['accommodations', 'criminal justice', 'deaf', 'interpreter', 'language access', 'police']",Translation and Interpreting Studies,John Benjamins Publishing Company,"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Language and Linguistics', 'Linguistics and Language']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,49.0,2023

These forms have so far only been studied for spoken languages and are said to form the ‘family of Away gestures’, which is semantically motivated by the effect of actions of removing or keeping away of things. Our corpus-based study aims to investigate these forms in four sign languages: Catalan, French Belgian, German, and Polish. We select and study a data sample that lasts approximately three hours.

Who’s got the upper hand? : A cross-linguistic study on overlap in VGT and LSFB,"© 2022 John Benjamins Publishing Company.A large body of research has highlighted the tight, carefully organised temporal coordination of interaction. When taking turns, people tend to minimise the occurrence of gaps and overlaps (Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson 1974). Within the field of signed language linguistics, however, there is an ongoing debate: while some researchers claim that signers orient to a ‘one-speaker-at-a-time’ principle (McCleary and Leite 2013) as found in spoken conversation, others argue that signed language interactions allow for more overlapping turns, displaying a more collaborative floor in their turn-taking mechanics (Coates and Sutton-Spence 2001). The current paper aims at contributing to this discussion by providing a first cross-linguistic, systematic account of the manifestation of overlap in two signed languages, namely LSFB (French Belgian Sign Language) and VGT (Flemish Sign Language). We analysed simultaneous signing in 2 hours of dyadic face-to-face conversations. This paper combines a quantitative account of the turn timing and thus frequency counts of overlap in VGT and LSFB interactions with a more fine-grained qualitative analysis of the interactional, i.e., sequential environment, in which overlap occurs and the strategies deployed to accomplish overlap resolution by deaf participants. In doing so, this paper sheds further light on the orderliness of signed conversation, and ultimately contributes to a better understanding of the semiotic complexity of multimodal interaction management across language ecologies (Ferrara and Hodge 2018).","['Namur Institute of Language, Text and Transmediality (NALTT)', 'KU Leuven']",['Belgium'],"['Lepeut A.', 'Beukeleers I.']","['conversation analysis', 'Flemish Sign Language (VGT)', 'French Belgian Sign Language (LSFB)', 'overlap', 'signed interaction', 'turn-taking']",Belgian Journal of Linguistics,John Benjamins Publishing Company,"['Language and Linguistics', 'Linguistics and Language']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,49.0,2022
L1 and non-L1 perceptions of discourse markers in English,"© 2022 John Benjamins Publishing Company.Although critical reception of discourse markers (DMs) such as like and you know has often been noted, surprisingly little research has actually investigated this attitudinal perspective on usage. Moreover, a recent, rapidly expanding body of research on non-L1 speakers’ use of discourse markers in English has suggested that their more or less frequent use of specific markers may be due to familiarity with these markers and positive or negative marker perceptions. The present study presents the results of a survey measuring British English L1 speakers’, English as Foreign Language (EFL) learners’, and English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) speakers’ perceptions of the discourse markers so, like, well and you know and their reactions to either abundance or lack of DMs. The survey measured speaker attitudes by asking participants to evaluate the usage of other DMs. We found that L1, EFL, and ELF have varying attitudes about certain markers, and these markers are perceived differently for traits like politeness and friendliness. Generally speaking, L1 speakers were more positively disposed towards markers than either of the other groups, who in their turn rated the propositional functions of the markers as more acceptable than interactional functions.",['KU Leuven'],['Belgium'],"['Blanchard M.', 'Buysse L.']","['discourse markers in L1 and non-L1', 'English as a foreign language', 'English as a lingua franca', 'interlanguage pragmatics', 'perception study']",Pragmatics and Cognition,John Benjamins Publishing Company,"['History and Philosophy of Science', 'Behavioral Neuroscience', 'Language and Linguistics', 'Computer Science (all)', 'Linguistics and Language']","['SOCI', 'ARTS', 'NEUR', 'COMP']",Article,0,27.0,2022

All rights reserved.This paper starts by discussing the economic impacts of technology and automation on translators’ activities. It then proposes a model to account for the depreciation of skills and respective economic consequences caused by technological changes, described as the translators' ‘obsolescence cycle’. This highlights the need for translators to adapt and reconfigure their expertise in order to accompany these changing circumstances, something that can be done by shifting the focus of their activities away from production towards more managerial responsibilities, including advisory, supervisory and planning functions. On a broader scale, management and the organisation of translation converge in the concept of translation policy, a still under-researched topic, which could prove to be a potentially rewarding field of action for translators.",['Universität Innsbruck'],['Austria'],['Sandrini P.'],"['Efficiency', 'Management', 'Organization', 'Productivity', 'Translation Business', 'Translation Policy', 'Translator’s Expertise']",Translation Matters,University of Porto Faculty of Arts and Humanities,"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Language and Linguistics', 'Linguistics and Language']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,31.0,2022

TABOO TRANSACTIONS: AN INITIAL DIACHRONIC APPROACH TO TRANSLATION AND SEX WORK,"© 2022, University of Porto Faculty of Arts and Humanities. All rights reserved.Translation is an ever-evolving form of transmission that carries with it ideas, hopes, politics, poetics, and desires. Building upon Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak’s assertion that “translation is the most intimate form of reading,” the present paper explores translation as a form of labor that can be described as intimate through metaphor and history. This paper offers a diachronic perspective on translation and erotic labor through the lens of metaphor, theory and translation history, and proposes that the marginal nature of both sex work and translation reflects a cultural aversion to alterity or otherness. Situated within these overlaps, this paper will trace 1) erotic dimensions of translation depicted through theory and metaphor; 2) a discussion on the figure of the yoginī from Hindu Tantric religion as well as the colonial construct of “sleeping dictionaries” as translator/ consort figures; and 3) examples from the contemporary intersections of translation, global commerce, and sex work.",['Universidade Católica Portuguesa'],['Portugal'],['Duffy E.M.P.'],"['Globalization', 'Prostitution', 'Sex Work', 'Sleeping Dictionary', 'Translation and Intimacy', 'Translation Metaphors', 'Yoginī']",Translation Matters,University of Porto Faculty of Arts and Humanities,"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Language and Linguistics', 'Linguistics and Language']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,41.0,2022
"SYSTEMS OF EXCHANGE: TRANSLATION, MONEY AND THE ECOLOGICAL TURN","© 2022, University of Porto Faculty of Arts and Humanities. All rights reserved.It is no coincidence that Marx, in the Grundrisse, spoke of money as a system of translation, while Saussure, in his Cours de linguistique générale, describes translation in terms taken from the political economy (Liu, 1999). Both are systems of exchange based on a concept of universal equivalence in which the exchange value attributed to the token (the coin or verbal sign) is unrelated to the inherent value of the material carrier. This has not always been the case, of course. Historically, coins and then paper money developed from the use as currency of intrinsically valuable commodities such as gold, while in semiotics, the conventional symbol evolved out of the motivated sign or icon. This paper traces the rise and demise of the universal equivalent in both translation and economics, and discusses the implications of the move back to an embedded and embodied understanding of meaning/value, with particularly attention to the ecological framework proposed by Michael Cronin (2017).",['NOVA-FCSH/CETAPS'],['Portugal'],['Bennett K.'],"['Ecological Turn', 'Money', 'Transcendental Signified', 'Translation', 'Universal Equivalent']",Translation Matters,University of Porto Faculty of Arts and Humanities,"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Language and Linguistics', 'Linguistics and Language']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,0,60.0,2022

2D numerical model of downward push pull ventilation for protecting workers against airborne infection Modelo numérico 2D de ventilación push pull descendente para proteger a los trabajadores contra las infecciones transmitidas por el aire,"© 2022, Editorial Salud, Ciencia y Tecnologia. All rights reserved.Industrial clusters contributed significantly to the spread of Covid-19 worldwide, including in Indonesia. One of the causes is that maintaining a minimum distance of 1 to 2 meters between workers is often challenging due to the plant layout and work system design limitations. Therefore, an intervention to the workstation is needed to protect industrial workers from potential exposure to Covid-19 and other airborne infections. One technology that has a high potential to be applied to solve this problem is the air curtain/personalized ventilation. This research analyzes the effectiveness of downward push-pull air curtain in protecting workers from inhaling the infected microdroplet. The extent to which the downward push-pull ventilation can withstand the burst of microdroplets was studied by varying the air speed ratios of the air curtain. A 2D simulation was carried out with Salome, OpenFOAM, and ParaView softwares. Two scenarios were tested, i.e., the distance between the person who is coughing is 0,5 and 1 meter from the air curtain. For the distance of 0,5 meter, the results showed that the optimum velocity ratio between the pushed and pulled air was 0,17 with a droplet penetration percentage of 8,98 %. While for 1 m, the optimum velocity ratio was 0,25 with a droplet penetration percentage of 5,67 %.","['Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember', 'Politeknik Perkapalan Negeri Surabaya']",['Indonesia'],"['Bramansyah D.H.', 'Dewi R.S.', 'Maryani A.', 'Wahyudin M.', 'Tamimah N.', 'Moballa B.']","['Covid-19', 'Droplets', 'Push-pull Ventilation', 'Speed Ratio']","Salud, Ciencia y Tecnologia","Editorial Salud, Ciencia y Tecnologia","['Health Professions (miscellaneous)', 'Nursing (miscellaneous)']","['NURS', 'HEAL']",Article,1,12.0,2022
Machine learning approach to predict delay in smart infusion pump Aprendizaje automático para predecir el retraso de una bomba de infusión inteligente,"© 2022, Editorial Salud, Ciencia y Tecnologia. All rights reserved.Wireless smart infusion pumps are currently under development. It is critical to ensure that the patient receives the correct drug concentration. Practically, the performance of the pump has relied on the minimum startup delay. The minimization of the startup delay is prominent in open-type infusion pumps and rarely in closed types. The emphasis on reducing startup delay puts practitioners and caregivers at ease while ensuring patient safety. The startup delay of the infusion pump is based on the flow rate and the lag time. The prediction of the flow rate and lag time for an infusion pump is necessitated to ensure a safe drug dosage for the patient. Currently, machine learning methods and computational methods to predict the desired parameter are widely used in healthcare applications and medical device performance. The reduction of start-up delay can be achieved by predicting its associated parameters lag time and flow rate. The flow rate is dependent on the speed of the infusion pump, which has to be calculated based on the number of gears and revolutions. The speed of the pump has to be predicted for accurate flow delivery. Our present research attempts to predict the lag time of an infusion pump using different kernel functions of support vector regression (SVR). The performance of the SVR for each kernel function is compared with R2, RMSE, MAE, and prediction accuracy. The prediction accuracy of 99,7 % has been obtained in optimized SVM.","['Vellore Institute of Technology', 'Ramaiah Institute of Technology']",['India'],"['Alamelu J.V.', 'Mythili A.']","['Delay', 'Flow Rate', 'Infusion Pump', 'Kernel', 'Prediction', 'SVR']","Salud, Ciencia y Tecnologia","Editorial Salud, Ciencia y Tecnologia","['Health Professions (miscellaneous)', 'Nursing (miscellaneous)']","['NURS', 'HEAL']",Article,0,25.0,2022
Unlock the Art of People Analytics through Workforce Competency Management Descubra el arte de la analítica de personal mediante la gestión de las competencias del personal,"© Este es un artículo en acceso abiertoData application in organizations has shifted its focus to meeting the legal requirements of employment. This shift in data use gradually altered the dynamics of the Human Resource Management (HRM) role, and organizations now expect high-quality analysis from HR professionals. Various studies suggested that the use of Human Resource Analytics (HRA) would assist HR professionals in developing diverse viewpoints on their contribution to the financial targets of organizations through the creation of suitable measurements. Still, not many researchers have explored the role of HRA in increasing the business outcomes of Indian organizations. In this study, we analysed the role of HRA competencies in determining business outcomes as well as examined the gap existing in the expected and existing competencies of HR analysts in Indian organizations. Our in-depth literature review prepared a conceptual framework based on Capability Motivation and Opportunity (CMO) model. A quantitative methodology was adopted to gather the data as it integrates the components of HRA competency and measures their impact on business outcomes. A structured questionnaire was designed and distributed to 230 HR professionals, including HRA users as well as HR managers who work in different organizations in the city of Bengaluru.

Monitoring tree mortality in Ukrainian Pinus sylvestris L. forests using remote sensing data from earth observing satellites,"© 2022, Editura Silvica. All rights reserved.This article considers the application of remote sensing data to solve the problems of forestry in the Polissia zone (Ukraine). The satellite remote sensing was shown to be applicable to monitoring the damage caused by diseases and pests to forest resources and to assessing the effects of fires. During the research, a detailed analysis and optimization of the information content of Sentinel-2 long-term data sets was performed to detect changes in the forest cover of Polissia, affected by pests and damaged by fires. The following classification algorithms were used for automated decryption: the maximum likelihood method; cluster classification without training; Principal Component Analysis (PCA); Random Forest classification. The results of this study indicate the high potential of Sentinel-2 data for application in applied problems of forestry and vegetation analysis, despite the decametric spatial resolution. Our proposed workflow has achieved an overall classification accuracy of 90 % for the Polissia region, indicating its reliability and potential for scaling to a higher level, and the proposed forecast model is stationary and does not depend on time parameters. To improve the classification results, testing of different combinations of bands emphasized the importance of Band 8 in combination with red edge bands, as well as other bands with a resolution of 10 m for summer scenes. The red margin shows clearly visible differences in the spectral profiles, but bands with a higher resolution of 10 m were crucial for good results.","['National Space Facilities Control and Test Center', 'Polissia National University', 'Chornobyl Radiation and Ecological Biosphere Reserve', 'Bogdan Khmelnitsky Melitopol State Pedagogical University']",['Ukraine'],"['Mozharovskii O.S.', 'Fedoniuk T.P.', 'Zhukov O.V.', 'Skydan O.V.', 'Pazych V.M.', 'Melnychuk T.', 'Zymaroieva A.A.']","['deforestation', 'forest fires', 'maximum likelihood method', 'pine']",Annals of Forest Research,Editura Silvica,"['Plant Science', 'Forestry', 'Ecology']","['AGRI', 'ENVI']",Article,2,20.0,2022

The Responses of Religions Outside of Islam toward the Ecological Crisis: A Literature Review Respon Agama di Luar Islam Terhadap Krisis Ekologi: Sebuah Kajian Literatur,"© 2022, Program Studi Ilmu Agama Islam Program Magister, Universitas Islam Indonesia. All rights reserved.This article is the result of an online-based literature review. This study formulates the following question: what are the responses of religions outside Islam in Indonesia regarding the ecological crisis? The primary data of this study are articles from scientific journals that focus on theo-ecology from the perspectives of Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism. The data were obtained through the Google Scholar and DOAJ pages. This study finds that first, Christianity responds to the ecological crisis by presenting the theo-ecological concept as part of the affirmation of faith in God. The teaching of environmental conservation is a way of glorifying all of God’s creations.

Stance in Flemish Sign Language : A multimodal and polysemiotic phenomenon,"© 2022 John Benjamins Publishing Company.In this contribution, we offer a first exploration of stance expressions in Flemish Sign Language (VGT). Biber and Finegan (1989) define stance as the expression of feelings, attitudes, judgments, commitments, and assessments. The few studies focusing on stance in signed languages have shown that stance can be expressed by various structures and mechanisms such as lexical signs, manual gestures (e.g., Palm Up gestures) and embodiment/ mental space blends. We will examine if these findings apply to Flemish Sign Language, and we will identify other means of expressing stance in VGT. In this exploratory study, we focus on the following questions: (1) which articulators and semiotic resources can be used in Flemish Sign Language to express stance?; and (2) How are visible bodily actions through different articulators integrated temporally in stance expressions? Our study is based on the analysis of about five hours of data from the Corpus Flemish Sign Language. We present examples from our dataset to illustrate that stance can be expressed through a range of structures and mechanisms (such as lexical signs, manual gestures, enactment, and non-manual features), expressed either sequentially or simultaneously by a multitude of articulators. Moreover, we zoom in on the phenomenon of stance-stacking and analyse how multiple stance expressions can be combined in VGT.","['Stellenbosch University', 'KU Leuven']","['Belgium', 'South Africa']","['Vermeerbergen M.', 'Brone G.', 'Andries F.']","['enactment', 'Flemish Sign Language', 'multimodality', 'polysemiotic', 'stance', 'stance-stacking']",Belgian Journal of Linguistics,John Benjamins Publishing Company,"['Language and Linguistics', 'Linguistics and Language']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,1,56.0,2022
Examination of Nurses’ Attitudes About Patient Safety According to Sociodemographic Characteristics,"© 2022, Knowledge E. All rights reserved.Background: Patient safety is a high priority for healthcare systems worldwide. It is considered an indicator of the quality of care. Establishing a patient safety attitude is the first priority in order to create a patient safety culture. Nurses play a critical role in protecting and supporting patients because of the nature of their job. In this way, especially nurses’ attitudes about patient safety will be determined, and threats to patient safety that may arise in the future will be prevented. Methods: In this regard, this study aimed to examine the nurses’ attitudes about patient safety according to certain sociodemographic characteristics. To accomplish this goal, the relevant data of the nurses were obtained by using the Patient Safety Attitude Scale consisting of 6 dimensions and 46 items. The research population consists of 245 nurses working in a University hospital in Ankara. The sample was not calculated, and a questionnaire was distributed to all employees of which 215 nurses completed the questionnaire. Data were collected between 1-30 April 2021. Ethics committee approval was obtained from the hospital. The data obtained were subjected to multivariate regression analysis. Results: The scale used was reliable (r=0.80). The mean of the general patient safety attitude scale is 3.22 with a standard deviation of 0.54. The majority of the participants were found to be between the age groups of 19-26 (38.1%), women (84.7%), and single (52.1%). We also found that the weekly working time of nurses and whether they got patient safety training or no had a statistically significant effect on patient safety attitudes (p<0.05). Therefore, it could be said that as the working time of nurses increased, a decrease in patient safety attitudes were observed, and they exhibited more patient safety attitudes as they got patient safety training. Conclusion: From this point of view, determining the weekly working hours of nurses more appropriately and making them more trained about patient safety may play a key role in creating a higher level of patient safety attitude.",['Hacettepe Üniversitesi'],['Turkey'],"['Ilgun G.', 'Cilhoroz Y.']","['healthcare', 'nurse', 'patient safety', 'patient safety attitude', 'patient safety culture']",Sudan Journal of Medical Sciences,Knowledge E,['Medicine (all)'],['MEDI'],Article,0,30.0,2022
Association Between Hemoglobin A1C and the Severity of Acute Ischemic Stroke in Sudanese Patients in Omdurman Military Hospital,"© 2022, Knowledge E. All rights reserved.Background: Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) levels are known to be linked to a higher risk of stroke. However, no research data is available on the impact of HbA1C on the severity of acute ischemic stroke in Sudan. Methods: This study is a descriptive, cross-sectional hospital-based study of 40 cases of acute ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke was confirmed using computed tomography (CT) scan at admission; all subjects’ blood HbA1C levels were also measured. Participants were divided into two subgroups based on HbA1C at admission, good glycemic control (GGC) (<7 HbA1C) and poor glycemic control (PGC) (>7 HbA1C), and neurological impairment was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Results: The age distribution of the participants was 45-85 years, with an average age of 63.5±9.2 years with the highest frequency (67.5%) in the age group of 55-75 years. PGC had a statistically significant high HbA1C value of 8.9±1.3 (P=0.000), when compared to GGC subgroups 5.1±0. The association between stroke severity and HbA1C levels on admission in this study was statistically significant (P value=0.005), on admission (78.6%) PGC had moderate to severe stroke (> 18.8 NIHSS) versus ( 33.3%) that of the GGC (>10.4NIHSS). The frequency of elevated HbA1C levels in patients with acute ischemic stroke was 70% in this study. Conclusion: PGC was shown to be linked to the occurrence of stroke and to its severity.","['Khartoum University', 'Alneelain University']",['Sudan'],"['Saeed A.M.', 'Farah M.A.O.', 'Abdelgadir O.A.E.', 'Ahmedelbasheir A.A.A.', 'Farah A.S.M.', 'Ahmed M.E.M.A.', 'Mahgoub M.S.S.', 'Elsayed A.A.A.', 'Ahmed A.K.M.']","['HbA1C', 'ischemic stroke', 'NIHSS']",Sudan Journal of Medical Sciences,Knowledge E,['Medicine (all)'],['MEDI'],Article,0,21.0,2022
Efficacy and Safety of Warfarin Therapy: Comparison Between Specialized INR Clinic and General Medical Clinic,"© 2022, Knowledge E. All rights reserved.Background: Although warfarin is known as effective oral anticoagulant to prevent thromboembolic events, its’ narrow therapeutic index requires ambient and good follow-up to reduce its therapeutic complications. There is a continuous debate whether the best practice to accomplish this goal is in a specialized international normalized ratio clinic (INR-C) or in a general medical clinic (General-C). Few, if any, studies have been done in Sudan to compare the safety and efficacy of anticoagulant therapy in those clinics. Thus, the objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of anticoagulant therapy in INR-C and in General-C. Methods: This is a prospective hospital-based study where 200 patients were divided into two groups (group A and B) of 100 patients. Group A were in the INR-C at Ahmed Gasim specialized hospital and group B in the General-Cat AL-Shaab teaching hospital. The study was conducted from September 2019 to April 2020. All patients were on warfarin treatment and regular follow-ups were conducted. Demographic and clinical data were collected and analyzed statistically using SPSS version 20. Ethical approval was obtained from the ethical committee of the Sudanese Medical Specialization Board (SMSB). Results: Of the 200 patients, 118/59% were females and 82/41% were males. Target international normalized ratio (INR) for group (A) was achieved in 56% of the patients in the first visit, increased to 63% in the second visit, and 75% in the third follow-up, compared with 24% of the patients from group (B) in the initial and second follow-up visit, to 43% in the third visit (P value=0.05). Knowledge about drug and food interaction of coagulation agents was higher (91%) among patients in group (A) compared with group (B) (56%). Drug interaction awareness was found in 89% of the patients in group (A) compared with only 40% in group (B) (P value=0.05). Major bleeding was reported in 2% and 14% of the patients of group (A) and (B) respectively, whereas minor bleeding was seen in 4% of group (A) and 11% of group (B). Conclusion: The study showed that INR-C is more efficient and safer for patients on regular warfarin therapy compared with the General-C.","['Al Neelain University', ""Ahmed Gasim Children's Hospital"", 'Assafa College']",['Sudan'],"['Fadl-Elmula I.', 'Ismail R.I.H.', 'Khalid R.', 'Osman O.E.']","['anticoagulant therapy', 'specialized INR clinic', 'warfarin']",Sudan Journal of Medical Sciences,Knowledge E,['Medicine (all)'],['MEDI'],Article,0,17.0,2022
Efficacy and Safety of Gum Arabic on Renal Failure Patients: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"© 2022, Knowledge E. All rights reserved.Background: Chronic Renal Failure (CRF) is a long-term disease caused by progressive kidney dysfunction due to many reasons leading to a significant rise in serum levels of creatinine and urea reaching the advanced stage where the patient goes for frequent hemodialysis. This study aims to discuss the evaluation of the efficacy of gum Arabic (GA) supplementation on the serum level of creatinine, urea, sodium, and potassium in CRF patients. Methods: Four databases PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library were searched for clinical trials assessment of gum Arabic intervention in CRF patients. Animal trials and experimental protocols were excluded. Screening of data and data extraction were done by two reviewers independently of each other. Meta-analysis was conducted on the selected studies using RevMan and the resulting description was summarized through the Forest plot tool on the efficacy of GA on 4 variables, creatinine, urea, sodium, and potassium in CRF patients. Results: From 574 studies searched, only 4 studies were included in this systemic review and meta-analysis. Although one of the studies had proved the objectives of the review but it was removed from the meta-analysis due to the heterogeneity caused by its inclusion. Conclusion: The few studies included in the current review revealed significant efficacy of GA treatment on the serum level of creatinine, urea, and sodium, but not potassium.","['Ghibaish College of Science and Technology', 'Shaqra University', 'University of Jeddah', 'Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University', 'Taibah University']","['Sudan', 'Saudi Arabia']","['Fadlalmola H.A.', 'Mariod A.A.', 'Salama S.M.', 'Osman E.G.', 'Hussein S.A.']","['clinical', 'Gum Arabic', 'Kidney']",Sudan Journal of Medical Sciences,Knowledge E,['Medicine (all)'],['MEDI'],Article,0,35.0,2022

Anxiety and Depression Among Sudanese Nurses During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-sectional Study,"© 2022, Knowledge E. All rights reserved.Background: While treating patients during a pandemic, nurses are at risk of mental health issues caused by the stress they face. This study aimed to examine the degree of anxiety and depression among Sudanese nurses throughout the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and demographic features and their association with depression and anxiety. Methods: An online-based cross-sectional study was conducted on Sudanese nurses. Data were collected from eligible nurses using a three-part questionnaire: demographic questions, the generalized anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7), and the major depression index (MDI). We used the Chi-square test and Spearman or point biserial correlation to assess the association between demographics, anxiety, and depression. Results: Two hundred and forty-six nurses from Sudan participated in this study. Around 69.5% of participants experienced mild to severe anxiety, while 26.4% revealed mild to severe depression. We found a significant association between depression and anxiety (P < 0.001). However, we did not find a significant association between depression or anxiety categories and the baseline characteristics of participants. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates high rates of anxiety and depression among Sudanese nurses throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. As we found no association between anxiety and depression with personal characteristics, psychological support should be given to all nurses’ categories as all of them nearly have the same risk for anxiety and depression.","['Khartoum University', 'Ghibaish College of Science and Technology', 'Almughtaribeen University', 'University of Hafr Al-Batin', 'Shaqra University', 'University of Jeddah', 'University of El Imam El Mahdi', 'University of Bisha', 'Al Neelain University', 'Najran University', 'Taibah University']","['Sudan', 'Saudi Arabia']","['Masaad H.Kh.', 'Osman A.M.', 'Fadlalmola H.A.', 'Mariod A.A.', 'Ebrahim S.A.', 'Yousif K.I.', 'Adam A.M.', 'Abdelmalik M.A.', 'Osman E.G.', 'Elhusein A.M.']","['anxiety', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'depression', 'Sudanese nurses']",Sudan Journal of Medical Sciences,Knowledge E,['Medicine (all)'],['MEDI'],Article,0,38.0,2022

Privatization of ager in africa from 123 to 63 b.c.,"Copyright © The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of The Classical Association.Scholars have generally underestimated the level of Roman involvement in Africa in the period between the annexation of Carthage in 146 b.c. and Caesar's victory at Thapsus in 46 b.c., and the land in Africa which the Romans annexed has been conventionally called public land (ager publicus). This paper analyses the surviving text of the African provisions of the epigraphic lex agraria of 111 b.c. and notes that the term ager publicus is not attested in the provincial section of the law. The land in Africa appears simply as ager in Africa and the term ager publicus is confined exclusively to Italy in the law of 111. However, Cicero's references to Rullus' agrarian proposal in 64/3 b.c. in the De lege agraria suggest that the term ager publicus was used to qualify land existing outside Italy in Rullus' proposal. This paper argues that the concept of ager publicus as opposed to private land developed in Africa between 111 and 63 b.c., and that this was linked to privatization of ager in Africa in this period. The results of this study suggest a high degree of Roman exploitation of African land prior to the Caesarean and Augustan colonies in the 40s b.c.",['Seoul National University'],['South Korea'],['Kim Y.-C.'],"[""ager publicus ('public land')"", 'De lege agraria', 'lex agraria of 111 b.c.', 'rogatio Seruilia (63 b.c.)', 'Roman agrarian laws', 'Roman North Africa']",Classical Quarterly,Cambridge University Press,"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'History', 'Philosophy', 'Classics']",['ARTS'],Article,0,13.0,2023

This article suggests that there is a clear allusion to the Metamorphoses in Tertullian's treatise Aduersus Valentinianos (beginning of the third century).

Entrepreneurship in The World of Metaverse: Virtual or Real?,"© 2022, Izmir Academy Association. All rights reserved.In this study, an in-depth literature review method was applied. Period; It examines academic studies and current information on the internet and its interpretation of entrepreneurship in the metaverse world. For those who want to be entrepreneurs in the world of Metaverse, business opportunities, conveniences and difficulties of Metaverse are evaluated. The concepts of virtual reality and virtual world, which are the leading steps of the rapidly developing digital age, are gaining importance. The metaverse world, which leads them and breaks new ground in the virtual world, is a universe in which it is predicted that investors will make large investments in terms of technology and economy. For this purpose, the researcher examined studies in the metaverse literature, and as a result of these studies, the subject of entrepreneurship in the metaverse world was discussed. In the metaverse world, the study results on entrepreneurship are seen as an opportunity to be seized economically. Those who will participate in the upcoming metaverse shift will seize this great opportunity. Another finding is that taking place in the metaverse world is not suitable for the time being in terms of costs. To avoid being affected by increasing costs, it is recommended that entrepreneurial individuals first determine a good idea and make a good feasibility study on how to realise this idea in the virtual world. This article is an original study that addresses the benefits, conveniences and challenges of being an entrepreneur in the Metaverse world. The literature review found no investigation on entrepreneurship in the Metaverse world. The fact that the Metaverse has the potential to have great effects on the business world and social life standards in the future makes this research more interesting. In addition, by specifying the impact of Metaverse on the business world, it has been tried to shed light on the problems and opportunities that large or smallscale enterprises and entrepreneurs will face in the future.",,,['Yemenici A.D.'],"['metaverse', 'NFT', 'virtual world', 'VR/AR', '— Entrepreneurship']",Journal of Metaverse,Izmir Academy Association,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Social Sciences (miscellaneous)']","['SOCI', 'COMP']",Review,14,78.0,2022
Constitutionalism and Human Rights: A Critical Analysis of the Rights of Transgender People in India,"© 2022 by Author(s).The movement for decriminalizing homosexual relations and the human rights of the LGBT community has gained momentum in the last decade. In India, various NGOs and LGBT society have fought a long battle demanding the decriminalization of homosexuality and declaring sexual orientation as part of the fundamental right to life under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. This paper explored the Indian legislative framework dealing with transgender people. Furthermore, it extensively covered the landmark judgments delivered by the Indian judiciary on the subject matter and highlighted that these judgments had played an essential role in uplifting the cause and protecting the fundamental rights of transgenders. Using doctrinal research as its methodology, this study showed that the Indian Constitution essentially provides a fundamental right to equality under Article 14, whereas Articles 15 and 16 outline that no one shall be discriminated on the ground of sex. Also, the Indian judiciary had decriminalized Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, considered as part of landmark judgments that recognize transgender people as a third gender. India also enacted the Transgender Protection Act 2019 to ensure the rights of transgenders. However, this Act failed to address the issue of forced sex-reassignment surgeries, which had been imposed upon transgender people against their consent. On the other hand, while transgenders are legally protected, gaining acceptance from society is another arduous task in which transgenders have struggled to realize an all-inclusive and non-judgmental environment towards persons with different sexual orientations.",['Khalsa Law College'],['India'],['Khanna P.'],"['Constitutionalism', 'Human Rights', 'Transgenders']",Lentera Hukum,University of Jember,"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Law']",['SOCI'],Article,0,30.0,2022
Investment in Indonesia After Constitutional Court’s Decision in the Review of Job Creation Law,"© 2022 by Author(s).In 2021, the Indonesian Constitutional Court decided conditionally unconstitutional in the review of the Job Creation Law. It was among a few decisions made by the Constitutional Court to accept a formal review, even if some dissenting opinions followed it. While the decision has largely influenced a wide array of regulatory laws because the Job Creation Law adopts the omnibus law model, the pivotal issue in this paper rests on the legal basis for investment in Indonesia after this decision. Firstly, it enquired whether the Constitutional Court exceeded its power for a procedural judicial review against the Job Creation Law. Second, it discussed the legal basis for investment in Indonesia after the Constitutional Court's Decision No. 91/PUU-XVIII/2020. Using normative research, the results showed that with the conditional unconstitutional decision, the Indonesian investment world would experience legal uncertainty for the next two years, especially new businesses, licensing, and investments with the enactment of the Job Creation Law. In particular, if the legislative branch failed to improve this law over two years, businesses, licensing, and investments in Indonesia might have no legal basis, resulting in the uncertain situation of the government’s desire to realize the friendly investment.","['Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia', 'Universitas Lambung Mangkurat', 'Universitas Islam Kalimantan']","['Indonesia', 'Malaysia']","['Ifrani', 'Komarudin P.', 'Nurhayati Y.', 'Zahir M.Z.M.']","['Constitutional Court', 'Job Creation Law', 'Judicial Review']",Lentera Hukum,University of Jember,"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Law']",['SOCI'],Article,1,49.0,2022
ASEAN Integration in the Context of Disaster Management,"© 2022 by Author(s).The COVID-19 pandemic, a globally unprecedented disease outbreak, has alarmed all governments to reconsider the importance of disaster management policies at the domestic level. At the same time, handling transboundary disasters was another challenge faced by regional organizations such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). As a result of this pandemic, all member states tended to act more independently by closing their territories and isolating their citizens from cross-border migration. This paper aimed to examine ASEAN's existing measures to address the COVID-19 pandemic, following the importance of considering domestic policies taken by its member states to portray the possible action at the regional level. In practice, each ASEAN member state had various approaches, from strict lockdowns such as those implemented in Singapore to Indonesian policies that were far from being prepared. While COVID-19 is a non-natural disaster but has had a devastating impact on Southeast Asia, the future of regional integration is at stake. This paper showed that each member state's different social, economic, and political situations influenced the absence of early common practices at the domestic level to overcome this pandemic. Simultaneously, market stability in Southeast Asia was the key to regional development, whereas this pandemic harmed ASEAN's aim to meet economic integration. This paper suggested that ASEAN should establish guidelines regarding disaster management as experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic for member states' domestic policies to anticipate possible adverse episodes in the future that may hamper the integration progress.","['Chonnam National University', 'Universitas Jember']","['South Korea', 'Indonesia']","['Afera G.G.', 'Ulum M.B.', 'Arundhati G.B.']","['ASEAN Integration', 'COVID-19', 'Disaster Management']",Lentera Hukum,University of Jember,"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Law']",['SOCI'],Article,0,58.0,2022
Power Sharing and Zoning Formula for Managing Nigeria's Diversity: A Case of the Fourth Republic,"© 2022 by Author(s).Nigeria is composed of plural and multi-complex societies with multiple ethnic groups of up to 500 cultural diversities. This country surmounts the obstacles of managing diversity through an informal setting popularly identified as a zoning formula and power sharing among the federating units. The pattern and trend in which the practice maintains Nigeria's diversity is a good lesson for a study of plural societies and consociationalism. The study aimed to examine the nature and dimension of zoning formula and power sharing in Nigeria and analyze how the strategies of zoning formula and power sharing helped manage diversity in Nigeria. The study was identified as a descriptive qualitative method that sought to describe Nigeria's strategy for managing diversity. The study uncovered that power sharing and zoning consist of constitutional and unconstitutional ones, with the former supported by legal provisions. Simultaneously, the latter is designed based on principles and gentleman agreements. The study recommended that constitutional provisions should never be sacrificed on the altar of the personal elite agreement. Instead, sharing power through zoning should be retained to prevent suicide for credibility and competency. It is a plausible shock absorber that will continue to sustain Nigerian federalism, and other plural societies can borrow this model as a political means of resolving diversities.","['Yobe State University', 'Federal University, Kashere']",['Nigeria'],"['Sambo U.', 'Sule B.']","['Consociationalism', 'Constitution', 'Nigeria']",Lentera Hukum,University of Jember,"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Law']",['SOCI'],Article,0,91.0,2022
Crowd Behavior Analysis and Prediction using the Feature Fusion Framework Análisis y predicción del comportamiento de las multitudes mediante el marco de fusión de características,"© Este es un artículo en acceso abierto,.The increasing number of people is a major cause of disasters that occur due to overcrowding. The gatherings of crowds in public places are a source of panic, which results in disaster. An analytical study was performed on crowd management. This is highly essential for the design of a well-planned public space, the possibility of surveillance in every area, and transportation systems. The disasters that occur due to uncontrollable crowd behaviour involve loss of property, fatalities, or casualties. To avoid this, the crowd’s behaviour was analysed. A MFF (multi-level feature fusion) framework was designed in this paper to predict behaviour. The first level of multi-level feature fusion employs motion and appearance, the second level employs spatial connections, and the third level employs temporal features. The combination of these characteristics aids in the exploitation of crowd behaviour. Furthermore, MFF was evaluated considering the web dataset, considering accuracy, precision, and recall as parameters.

All rights reserved.Machine Learning under Resource Constraints addresses novel machine learning algorithms that are challenged by high-throughput data, by high dimensions, or by complex structures of the data in three volumes. Resource constraints are given by the relation between the demands for processing the data and the capacity of the computing machinery. The resources are runtime, memory, communication, and energy. Hence, modern computer architectures play a significant role. Novel machine learning algorithms are optimized with regard to minimal resource consumption. Moreover, learned predictions are executed on diverse architectures to save resources. It provides a comprehensive overview of the novel approaches to machine learning research that consider resource constraints, as well as the application of the described methods in various domains of science and engineering.",['Technische Universität Dortmund'],['Germany'],"['Rahnenfuhrer J.', 'Wietfeld C.', 'Morik K.']","['Artificial intelligence', 'Big data and machine learning', 'Cyber-physical systems', 'Data mining for ubiquitous system software', 'Embedded systems and machine learning', 'Highly distributed Data', 'Machine learning for knowledge discovery', 'Machine learning in high-energy physics', 'ML on small devices', 'Resource-aware machine learning', 'Resource-constrained data analysis']",Machine Learning under Resource Constraints,De Gruyter,"['Computer Science (all)', 'Chemistry (all)']","['CHEM', 'COMP']",Book,0,772.0,
Talking about moving machines: An argumentative perspective,"© John Benjamins Publishing Company.Globally, robots can be described as some sets of moving parts that are dedicated to a task while using their own energy. Yet, humans commonly qualify those machines as being intelligent, autonomous or being able to learn, know, feel, make decisions, etc. Is it merely a way of talking or does it mean that robots could eventually be more than a complex set of moving parts? On the one hand, the language of robotics allows multiple interpretations (leading sometimes to misreading or confusion in various contexts). On the other hand, the status of robots is challenged more and more by technical achievements and humans’ own empirical beliefs. In this paper, we follow a linguistic approach in order to explore the relevance of these words when talking about robots. Since we note that the words impose themselves (even if opposed), we discuss the efficiency of a rhetorical strategy in order to work with such a lexicon in robotics. More precisely, we explore the argumentative technique of the dissociation of notions through the study of a practical case: the case of robot lawn mowers versus hedgehogs.","['INRIA Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique', ""Laboratoire d'Analyse et d'Architecture des Systemes"", 'Université Libre de Bruxelles', 'Universität Wien']","['Belgium', 'Austria', 'France']","['Soueres P.', 'Danblon E.', 'Laumond J.-P.', 'Pieters C.']","['ethics', 'intelligent robots', 'rhetoric', 'robot autonomy', 'robot motion']",Interaction Studies,John Benjamins Publishing Company,"['Language and Linguistics', 'Animal Science and Zoology', 'Linguistics and Language', 'Communication', 'Human-Computer Interaction']","['SOCI', 'ARTS', 'COMP', 'AGRI']",Article,0,31.0,2004
Second language acquisition of depicting signs : A corpus-based account,"© John Benjamins Publishing Company.This paper concerns the acquisition of the sign lexicon in L2 learners of Swedish Sign Language. Sampled data (conversation and narrative retelling) from a longitudinal learner corpus with 16 adult L2 signers was analyzed and compared with data from nine L1 signers. The use of three broad types of signs was analyzed: lexical signs, partly-lexical signs (i.e. depicting signs) and non-lexical signs. The results revealed some differences between L1 and L2 signers, especially with regard to depicting signs. The number of depicting signs used by L2 learners increased over time, approaching the target language use. Qualitatively, we observed differences between L1 and L2 signers in their use of depicting signs, related to handshape choice and sign constructions. We discuss these findings in light of previous research linked to L2 vocabulary as well as the role of gestural knowledge in sign L2 acquisition.",['Stockholms universitet'],['Sweden'],"['Schonstrom K.', 'Mesch J.']","['L2M2', 'lexicon', 'sign language', 'sign types']","LIA Language, Interaction and Acquisition",John Benjamins Publishing Company,"['Linguistics and Language', 'Language and Linguistics', 'Communication']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,1,55.0,2011
Measuring language dominance in bilinguals with two sign languages,"© John Benjamins Publishing Company.This study examines whether a multi-faceted construct of language dominance developed for spoken languages applies to signed language bilinguals. Sign languages have been described as highly iconic and relatively similar to each other compared to spoken languages. Attaining fluency in the signed modality might well require considerably less effort, and balanced bilingualism may be more prevalent in the signed modality. Language dominance constructs, as currently understood, might differ in the spoken and signed modality. Forty bilinguals with two sign languages responded to a language dominance questionnaire developed for spoken languages and performed a phonological fluency (sign generation) task. Language dominance levels were found to vary in the signed modality. The correlation between reported dominance levels and the number of signs generated in each sign language was significant, suggesting that the construct of language dominance tested is robust and independent of modality.",['The University of Texas at Austin'],['United States'],['Lindeberg D.J.'],"['acquisition', 'bilingualism', 'iconicity', 'language dominance', 'sign language']","LIA Language, Interaction and Acquisition",John Benjamins Publishing Company,"['Linguistics and Language', 'Language and Linguistics', 'Communication']","['SOCI', 'ARTS']",Article,1,66.0,2011
What’s in a mime? : An exploratory analysis of predictors of communicative success of pantomime,"© John Benjamins Publishing Company.Several lines of research within developmental psychology, experimental semiotics and language origins studies have recently converged in their interest in pantomime as a system of bodily communication distinct from both language (spoken or signed) and nonlinguistic gesticulation. These approaches underscore the effectiveness of pantomime, which despite lack of semiotic conventions is capable of communicating complex meanings. However, very little research is available on the structural underpinnings of this effectiveness, that is, the specific properties of pantomime that determine its communicative success. To help fill in this gap, we conducted an exploratory rating study aimed at identifying those properties of pantomime that facilitate its understanding. We analysed an existing corpus of 602 recordings of whole-body re-enactments of short transitive events, coding each of them for 6 properties, and found out that the presence of salient elements (conspicuous objects in a specific semantic space), image mapping (representing the physical orientation of the object), and gender markers (distinguishing between the represented characters) increased the guessability of pantomimes.","['Uniwersytet Mikołaja Kopernika w Toruniu', 'Lunds Universitet']","['Poland', 'Sweden']","['Sibierska M.', 'Wacewicz S.', 'Zywiczynski P.', 'Boruta-Zywiczynska M.']","['bodily mimesis', 'communicative success', 'non-verbal communication', 'pantomime']",Interaction Studies,John Benjamins Publishing Company,"['Language and Linguistics', 'Animal Science and Zoology', 'Linguistics and Language', 'Communication', 'Human-Computer Interaction']","['SOCI', 'ARTS', 'COMP', 'AGRI']",Article,0,51.0,2004

Language policy in Italian universities: Navigating the language ambiguities of higher education internationalisation,"© John Benjamins Publishing Company.In recent years, the significant expansion of English-medium instruction (EMI) programmes across higher education institutions outside English-speaking contexts has brought with it an inherent set of language-related tensions and ambiguities. In this article, we explore how a selection of Italian universities have tackled these tensions. Via a content analysis of university policy documents, we investigate the key language-related themes in them, and the orientations to language that these themes entail. The results show that English is seen as necessary for and almost synonymous to internationalisation, as well as a language that can bring benefits to both institutions and individuals. However, a commitment to multilingualism and to the promotion of Italian from a non-protectionist stance is apparent in the documents analysed. This finding, we argue, puts the Italian context apart from other settings that have been previously investigated (e.g. the Nordic countries), and points to an original way in which universities can navigate the language ambiguities that come with the process of higher education internationalisation.","['Università degli Studi Roma Tre', 'Stockholms universitet']","['Italy', 'Sweden']","['Soler J.', 'Bjorkman-Nylen B.', 'Zuaro B.']","['English', 'English-medium instruction', 'higher education', 'Italian', 'language policy']",Language Problems and Language Planning,John Benjamins Publishing Company,"['Linguistics and Language', 'Communication']",['SOCI'],Article,0,70.0,1977

When and how to revise? Building a cognitive dyad of translator and reviser through workflow adjustment,"© John Benjamins Publishing Company.The translation production team that consists of a translator and a reviser can be investigated as a specific kind of (sub)system of socially distributed cognition, a cognitive dyad; this system is defined as only including the translation professionals who are directly involved in the drafting of the translation. Based on interviews with translation professionals, I argue that this fine-tuned cognitive dyad gets its form not only as a result of its participants' characteristics, but also under the influence of other factors, some of which vary from one project to the next, leading to the flexible formation of the reviser's task in particular. The three most important project-specific influencing factors are the text genre, the translator's experience and competence, and the client's needs and requirements. While genre and the client's needs and requirements seem to have a markedly similar impact, mainly influencing the internal task configuration of the cognitive dyad, the translator's experience and competence often leads to non-revision.

Examination of the Appropriate Inference Procedure in a Model Structure for Harvest-Based Estimation of Sika Deer Abundance,"© The Mammal Society of Japan. The Mammal Society of Japan.To obtain proper estimates of wildlife abundance by harvest-based models (HBMs), an understanding of the model structure and data properties is required. Otherwise, there may be a risk of failure to obtaining adequate estimates. In this study, we estimated the abundance of sika deer using several spatially fine-scale HBMs with different structures and aimed to clarify the effects of the model structure and data quality on estimates. We used monitoring data collected by the Gifu Prefectural Government and other data collected by the authors. Four HBMs were constructed according to the combinations of the model structure (considering overdispersion in the observation models) and data (with or without additional observation data), and their parameters were estimated. The results showed that among the four HBMs, reasonable deer abundance was estimated by two HBMs in which overdispersion was considered in the observation models of the less precision data only. As the parameters failed to converge in the other two HBMs in which overdispersion was considered in all observation models, the abundance would be overestimated. Thus, our results confirmed that understanding the model structure and data properties was essential for obtaining proper estimates of wildlife abundance from currently available data with HBM.","['Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute', 'Gifu University']",['Japan'],"['Ikeda T.', 'Ando M.', 'Iijima H.']","['Cervus nippon', 'data property', 'harvest-based model', 'overdispersion', 'spatially fine-scale model']",Mammal Study,Mammalogical Society of Japan,['Animal Science and Zoology'],['AGRI'],Article,0,45.0,2008

Leveling breaks in the innovative development of socio-economic systems,"© The Author(s) 2022.The chapter accounts for the problem of identification and leveling breaks in the innovative development of socio-economic systems in example of Ukraine in the face of new challenges for the state in the process of developing relations with the EU. The aim of the chapter is to assess the level of innovation competitiveness of the Ukrainian economy and determine the most important factors for leveling breaks in its innovative development in the conditions of association with the EU. The analysis of world rankings has shown that the innovative development of Ukraine determines comparative factor advantages in coverage of higher education, availability of scientific staff, and quality of research institutions, but low state support, lack of stability, and problems in institutional development hamper the country's innovative potential. Cluster analysis showed that Ukraine is in the same cluster as Poland. Bulgaria and Romania, which have not yet fully consistent with the level of technological competitiveness of EU leaders. Among the strengths of Ukraine is the development of human resources and labor effect. The correlation analysis between the components of the Global Innovation Index and the factors of increasing Ukraine's competitiveness indicates a moderate link between the development of clusters, the ratio of expenditures on R&D to GDP, and the export of ICT services. In order to level breaks in the innovative development of Ukraine it's necessary: to increase both foreign investments and state financing; improvement of regulatory acts, reduction of corruption, institutional improvement; support of technologies through of regional cluster programs or ""smart specialization""; integration into the European Research Area.",['V.

Composite materials based on water-soluble binders for electrochemical capacitors,"© The Author(s) 2022.Today, more and more attention is paid to non-traditional rechargeable sources of electric current, which are able to quickly charge and discharge (in a few seconds or minutes), have high power (kW/kg) and a long service life (tens of thousands of charge-discharge cycles). Such current sources include electrochemical capacitors (EC), which in the special literature are called superca-pacitors, ultracapacitors, ionistors, or molecular storage devices. The principle of operation of such current sources is based on their ability to store and release electrical energy at a given time through the internal redistribution of electrolyte ions in a double electric layer (DEL). The rate of redistribution of ions in the DEL is several orders of magnitude higher than the rate of ion transfer through the ""electrode-electrolyte"" phase boundary during classical redox transformations in batteries. That is why ECs are non-traditional current sources, they have significant advantages over batteries in terms of their specific power, the rate of charge-discharge processes and service life, although they are inferior to batteries in terms of their capacity and energy density. Particular attention has been paid to EC in connection with the start of production in many countries of the world of environmentally friendly cars and buses with electric motors that require high power at the time of engine start. In addition to being used in transport, ECs are widely used in military and space technology, in energy storage systems at peak loads, for regulating wind generator turbines, etc. The production of electrochemical capacitors requires fairly large capital investments. This is due to the requirements for the environmental friendliness of the production itself, where a significant amount of costs is spent on ensuring safe working conditions for personnel, on capturing harmful substances and their disposal. That is why the issue of developing EC to reduce the cost of production through the use of new materials and the improvement of technological processes becomes especially relevant. The main scientific research in recent years in the field of EC has been associated with the study of new electrochemical systems, electrode materials and electrolytes. To a certain, but insufficient extent, attention was also paid to the improvement of the technology of combining the active material and the current collector. Even less research work is related to the development of environmentally friendly technologies for the production of composite active materials for capacitors, although the development of these components can potentially provide high electrical performance of capacitors and significantly reduce the cost of their production. These circumstances put forward the research and development of environmentally friendly methods for obtaining composite materials for electrochemical capacitors into the category of complex, but relevant scientific and technical problems.","['Armed Forces of Ukraine', 'Kyiv National University of Technologies and Design']",['Ukraine'],"['Chernysh O.', 'Tverdokhlib V.', 'Slobodianyk V.', 'Berezovskij A.', 'Barsukov V.', 'Khomenko V.']","['Activated carbon', 'Cellular carbonaceous material', 'Electrochemical capacitor', 'Graphite', 'Polymer-carbon composite', 'Water-based polymers']",Energy facilities: Management and design and technological innovations,Technology Center,['Engineering (all)'],['ENGI'],Book Chapter,0,78.0,
Innovative development of national economies,"© 2022 Authors. All rights reserved.Collective monograph contains the results of scientific research on topical issues of development of innovation systems at the National level. The problems posed are considered in various aspects, so the results of the research are of practical interest, and their use can contribute to the formation of a policy for the development of regional economies. Section 1 presents the results of a study of the formation processes and features of the functioning of the National innovation system (NIS), its main components and the links between them. In particular, Investment and innovation systems (IIS) are studied as key institutions of the NIS, characterized by a pronounced system-forming function. A block diagram of the National innovation system has been developed, which includes four main institutional subsystems and subsystems of specific links, which, in fact, ensure the functioning of both institutional subsystems and the entire NIS. The algorithm of their functioning is defined on the basis of its representation by means of a system of inequalities of criterion conditions. Section 2 analyzes the impact of nanoeconomics on the macroeconomics of an individual state based on the characteristics of the nature of nanoeconomics, its tangible and intangible forms, regularities, and evolution. The system of households as cells of individual consumption is characterized and it is shown that the structure of the national economy as part of the service sector, industry and the agro-industrial complex forms an entrepreneurial sector with active individuals. A close relationship has been established between the indicators of the development of nanoeconomics of the macroeconomic situation in a particular country and the relevance of the individual systemic factor for the development of national economic systems has been proved. Section 3 discusses the problem of identifying and leveling the breaks in the innovative development of socio-economic systems on the example of Ukraine in the face of new challenges for the state in the process of developing relations with the EU. An assessment of the level of innovative competitiveness of the Ukrainian economy is made and the most important factors for leveling interruptions in its innovative development in the conditions of association with the EU are identified. Recommendations are given for scheduling breaks in the innovative development of Ukraine. Among them: increased foreign investment and public funding; improvement of legal acts, reduction of corruption, institutional improvement; technology support through regional cluster programs or ""smart specialization""; integration into the European Research Area. In Section 4, within the framework of the study of an innovative model of regional management of freshwater resources, environmental priorities, innovative investment dominants, targets and a model of environmentally balanced management of freshwater resources at the regional level are identified. This provides a more objective and balanced assessment of possible schemes and tools for managing the territory's freshwater resources.

Electricity consumption and renewable energy sources generation schedules coordination in electric networks for balance reliability increasing,"© The Author(s) 2022.The chapter analyzes the schedules of electricity consumption and generation in the electricity network with renewable energy sources (RES) as an opportunity to improve the electricity balance in it. It is shown that in order to achieve a positive effect from the introduction of RES into the electric grid, a balance of electricity generation and consumption must be ensured in it. To do this, first of all, the values of the optimal installed power of RES are determined to coordinate the generation and electricity consumption schedules, and the principles of consumption management in the electric network are formed. In order to increase the stability of power supply systems, it is proposed to use electric power accumulators, which, if there is a certain energy reserve in the accumulator, can be used in case of an insufficient amount of RES generation. An algorithm for the method of matching the generation schedules of the PV power plants and the electric load of the network has been developed. At the same time, the cost of displacement of consumption power is estimated, for which a corresponding indicator has been developed. Since the quality of power supply depends not only on the balance of active power, but also reactive power, RES with inverter energy conversion devices are considered as a means of regulating reactive power in the electrical network in order to maintain the voltage within acceptable limits.",['Vinnytsia National Technical University'],['Ukraine'],"['Lesko V.', 'Lezhniuk P.', 'Komar V.', 'Netrebskyi V.', 'Sikorska O.', 'Malogulko Y.']","['Coordination', 'Electric energy balance', 'Electric network', 'Generation and consumption schedules', 'Renewable energy sources']",Energy facilities: Management and design and technological innovations,Technology Center,['Engineering (all)'],['ENGI'],Book Chapter,1,30.0,
System of proactive control of reactive power flows in distributed electrical grids,"© The Author(s) 2022.The paper solves the urgent problem of improving the methods and means of optimizing reactive power flows in distribution grids with significant daily volatility in the generation and consumption of electricity. The object of research is the process of automated control of a set of reactive power sources (RPS) in distribution electrical grids (DEG). Coordination of their operation will contribute to the reduction of electricity losses in the DEG and improve the voltage quality. Based on the results of the analysis of modern trends in the construction of RPS control systems, the expediency of decentralization using local automatic control systems (ACS) is substantiated. The operational determination of the optimal powers of the RPS and the calculation of the corresponding settings of local ACS are associated with objective difficulties. The study proposes a formalization of the problem of optimizing reactive power flows in DEG and a new way to solve it. It is shown that the problem can be reduced to the determination and periodic correction of the settings of local systems of automatic control of the RPS. The latter, by adjusting the energy flows according to local parameters, taking into account the specified settings, contribute to the achievement of the overall effect of reducing losses and stabilizing the voltage in the DEG. The proposed method contributes to a reasonable simplification and increase in the reliability of the distributed control system for reactive power flows in the DEG, taking into account technical limitations. To solve the problem, the principle of advancing control, the method of ""ideal"" current distribution (according to power losses) was applied. Using the model of ""ideal"" current distribution, the problem of nonlinear optimization of reactive power flows in the DEG was reduced to a fundamentally simpler problem of finding current distribution in a step-by-step circuit with active resistances. To determine the time intervals between the adjustment of local ACS, it is proposed to analyze the correlation between the predictive graph of the optimal power of an individual RPS and local energy consumption based on the Pearson coefficient. A block diagram and algorithms for the operation of the control system for the set of RPSs are proposed, which provide a minimum of computational operations and data exchange operations. At the same time, a response is provided to changes in the consumption and generation of electricity in the conditions of short-term failures of information systems. This contributes to improving the quality of operation of energy distribution systems in modern conditions.","['Vinnytsia National Technical University', 'JSC Vinnytsiaoblenergo', 'Lutsk National Technical University']",['Ukraine'],"['Hrytsiuk Y.', 'Kulyk V.', 'Teptya V.', 'Polishchuk A.', 'Hrytsiuk I.', 'Vishnevskyi S.']","['Losses', 'Optimization, ""ideal"" current distribution', 'Power distribution system', 'Proactive control', 'Reactive power sources', 'Voltage quality']",Energy facilities: Management and design and technological innovations,Technology Center,['Engineering (all)'],['ENGI'],Book Chapter,0,50.0,
Structural and technological solutions for film solar cells based on CDS/CDTE for reserve power supply of emergency prevention systems,"© The Author(s) 2022.Investigations of solar cells based on CdS/CdTe, designed for reserve power supply of security systems and control of objects in conditions of damage to the power supply system, have been carried out. An analysis is made of losses in the initial parameters of solar cells based on cadmium telluride, which are due to the design features of the device structure and photoelectric processes occurring in their volume upon absorption of light. Implemented approaches to increasing the efficiency of a photocell based on CdS/CdTe and their effectiveness are studied. Ways are proposed to increase the efficiency of such film solar cells by improving the method of obtaining a rear contact. Design and technological solutions for SC ITO/CdS/CdTe/Cu/Au have been developed, which make it possible to obtain laboratory samples with an efficiency factor of more than 10 %. Laboratory samples of ITO/CdS/CdTe/Cu/ITO CEs have been fabricated, the two-sided illumination of which makes it possible to increase the electric power by 30 %. The research of Cu/ITO transparent rear contacts for CdTe-based solar cells intended for use in tandem and bilaterally sensitive device structures have been studied. The study of the light Current-voltage characteristics of SnO2:F/CdS/CdTe/Cu/ITO solar cells under illumination from both sides made it possible to establish significant differences in the initial parameters and light diode characteristics under illumination from the side of the glass substrate and from the side of the transparent rear electrode. Testing of laboratory samples of ITO/CdS/CdTe/Cu/ITO solar cells as part of tandem photovoltaic converters has been carried out.

Research of impact of nanoeconomics on the National economic system development,"© The Author(s) 2022.The diverse world is striking in the multitude of forms and types of various economic phenomena. Yes, the economy is characterized by the existence of different levels. The most decisive is the macro level, as the level of development of national economic systems. It is described by such categories as social reproduction, economic development and growth, economic balance and economic structure. All these phenomena depend to a certain extent on the economic behavior of individual economic agents that form the nanoeconomics. An analysis was made of the impact of nanoeconomics on the macroeconomics of an individual state based on the characteristics of the nature of nanoeconomics, its material and non-material forms, regularities and evolution. Separately, the system of households was characterized as a center of individual consumption. It was also noted that the structure of the national economy as part of the service sector, industry and the agro-industrial complex forms an entrepreneurial sector with active individuals. The latter are a spokesman for nanoeconomics as a kind of innovative economy, because nanoeconomics forms a high-quality system for the development and implementation of nanotechnological production solutions. The amount of research and development costs affects the volume of industrial and agricultural products sold and the number of services provided. The distinctive features of the obtained results can be considered the approximation of the regression coefficient to unity, which indicates the presence of a close relationship between the indicators of the development of nanoeconomics on the macroeconomic situation in a particular country. Conclusions were drawn on the relevance of the individual systemic factor for the development of national economic systems.","['National Aviation University', 'Kyiv National University of Technologies and Design']",['Ukraine'],"['Krasniuk S.', 'Palyvoda O.', 'Danilova E.', 'Onopriienko D.', 'Ostapenko T.', 'Hrashchenko I.']","['Baby economics', 'Human economics', 'Macroeconomics.', 'Nanoeconomics', 'Nanotechnology economics', 'Simple social reproduction']",Innovative development of national economies,Technology Center,"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)', 'Business, Management and Accounting (all)']","['BUSI', 'ECON']",Book Chapter,0,21.0,
"Self-assembled supramolecular artificial light-harvesting nanosystems: construction, modulation, and applications","© 2023 RSC.Artificial light-harvesting systems, an elegant way to capture, transfer and utilize solar energy, have attracted great attention in recent years. As the primary step of natural photosynthesis, the principle of light-harvesting systems has been intensively investigated, which is further employed for artificial construction of such systems. Supramolecular self-assembly is one of the feasible methods for building artificial light-harvesting systems, which also offers an advantageous pathway for improving light-harvesting efficiency. Many artificial light-harvesting systems based on supramolecular self-assembly have been successfully constructed at the nanoscale with extremely high donor/acceptor ratios, energy transfer efficiency and the antenna effect, which manifests that self-assembled supramolecular nanosystems are indeed a viable way for constructing efficient light-harvesting systems. Non-covalent interactions of supramolecular self-assembly provide diverse approaches to improve the efficiency of artificial light-harvesting systems. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in artificial light-harvesting systems based on self-assembled supramolecular nanosystems. The construction, modulation, and applications of self-assembled supramolecular light-harvesting systems are presented, and the corresponding mechanisms, research prospects and challenges are also briefly highlighted and discussed.","['Kent State University', 'Southeast University', 'Nanjing University']","['United States', 'China']","['Zhang S.', 'Hou X.-F.', 'Chen X.', 'Li Q.', 'Chen X.-M.', 'Chen D.']",,Nanoscale Advances,Royal Society of Chemistry,"['Materials Science (all)', 'Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics', 'Chemistry (all)', 'Bioengineering', 'Engineering (all)']","['CHEM', 'MATE', 'ENGI', 'CENG', 'PHYS']",Review,15,136.0,2023

ANOREXIA NERVOSA IN A PAKISTANI ADOLESCENT GIRL: A CASE REPORT,"© 2022, Postgraduate Medical Institute. All rights reserved.Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by very low body weight, excessive self-restriction of food intake due to fear of gaining weight, and a distorted self-perception of the body. We report a case of a 14-year-old girl, admitted to the psychiatry ward with the chief complaints of reluctance to eat and drink, headache, weakness, weight loss, and decreased sleep, for the last year. After the assessment by the psychiatrist, and relevant investigations, she was diagnosed with a case of anorexia nervosa. She was advised to have standard electronic cognitive behavioural therapy, in addition to the pharmacological treatment, and was referred to a dietician who suggested a well-balanced and tailored diet with optimum proportions of macro and micronutrients. After 2 weeks of the initiation of the treatment, her eating habits and negative thoughts were improved and she was discharged from the hospital with a suggested regular follow-up of 2 weeks.",['Khyber Medical College'],['Pakistan'],"['Asghar S.', 'Khan S.A.']","['Anorexia Nervosa', 'Body Weight', 'Eating Disorders']",Journal of Postgraduate Medical Institute,Postgraduate Medical Institute,['Medicine (all)'],['MEDI'],Article,0,8.0,2022

Historical overview of the use of the term acric in Slovenian soil classification ZGODOVINSKI PREGLED UPORABE IZRAZA AKRIČNOST V SLOVENSKI KLASIFIKACIJI TAL,"© 2022, Zveza geografov Slovenije. All rights reserved.In naming and classifying soils in Slovenia, we faced challenges from the beginning, resulting from the introduction of foreign, unfamiliar terms and changes in diagnostic criteria and analytical procedures for their verification. When translating the names of Soil Systematic Units of the Soil Map of Slovenia 1:25,000 for international publications and soil maps of Europe, misunderstandings could arise. Acric soils are defined in the Soil Map of Slovenia as very acidic soils with base saturation below 35% and belong to the Illuvial soils. The WRB classification criterion for acric properties is the low cation exchange capacity of the clay fraction of the soil (< 24 cmolc kg-1 clay) with a simultaneous effective base saturation below 50%. Soils with an argic horizon and acric properties are referred to as reference group Acrisols. Illuvial acric soils have been translated as Acrisols, which is incorrect according to WRB classification criteria and is misleading, especially for foreign readers unfamiliar with soils in Slovenia and Slovenian classification cri-teria. In this paper, we examine the history of the use of the term acric in Slovenian pedological literature and soil classification, as well as the diagnostic properties and criteria associated with this term. We found out that the term acric was introduced in 1973 based on the legend of the FAO soil map of 1968. Different criteria (horizons, properties, analytical methods) were used in the different periods, which were not updat-ed with the development of the international WRB classification.",['Univerza v Ljubljani'],['Slovenia'],"['Grcman H.', 'Turniski R.', 'Zupan M.']","['acric soil', 'Acrisols', 'illuvial soil', 'leached soil', 'Slovenian soil classification', 'WRB', 'Yugoslav soil classification']",Geografski Vestnik,Zveza geografov Slovenije,"['Earth-Surface Processes', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","['SOCI', 'EART']",Article,0,48.0,2022

Social determinants of tuberculosis in Nigeria: an ecological approach,"©2022 The Authors.and PAGEPRESS PUBLICATIONS.Background: Nigeria is 4th among 22 tuberculosis high-burden coun-tries. However, TB is not evenly distributed in the country, presumably due to state-specific risk factors. Objectives: This study maps TB and socioeconomic risk factors in Nigeria. Methods: State-level age/sex standardized tuberculosis notification data was utilized in an ecological design to evaluate the spatial distribu-tion of TB in Nigeria and its social and economic consequences between 2012 and 2015. Negative binomial regression analysis examined the relationship between TB and five state-level covariates: HIV, BCG coverage, GDP per capita, percentage underweight, and percentage treatment success rate. Global and Local Moran’s I test statistics in R were used for spatial analysis. Results: The mean age/sex TB CNR was 54.4/100,000. Non-spatial ecological regression analysis found that TB was greater in states with high HIV, low BCG, low GDP per capita, and low TB death rates. Three states—Nasarawa, Benue, and Taraba—had high TB rates and spatially auto-correlated TB CNRs. Conclusions: TB case notification differed by age and gender. Economically-disadvantaged states exhibited higher TB case notifi-cation, HIV prevalence, lower BCG coverage, and lower mortality rates. The study found three TB hotspots. To reduce the national TB notification rate discrepancy, TB policies should incorporate social variables and target high-risk states with specific initiatives.","['Olabisi Onabanjo University', 'Lagos State University Teaching Hospital']",['Nigeria'],"['Alabi A.', 'Adejumo O.', 'Daniel O.', 'Oritogun K.', 'Bamidele J.', 'Gbadebo A.']","['ecological', 'inequality', 'social determinants', 'spatial', 'Tuberculosis']",Journal of Public Health in Africa,Page Press Publications,"['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health']",['MEDI'],Article,0,33.0,2022

This borderline is fundamentally semantically indeterminable, because associations, puns and cynicism cannot be banned. The legal instruments often come to nothing, because a judiciary under the rule of law may only sanction deeds, not thoughts. Each judgement inevitably redefines this borderline, at least in nuances.

Nano and microparticle drug delivery systems for the treatment of Brucella infections,"© 2023Nano-based drug delivery systems are increasingly used for diagnosis, prevention and treatment of several diseases, thanks to several beneficial properties, including the ability to target specific cells or organs, allowing to reduce treatment costs and side effects frequently associated with chemotherapeutic medications, thereby improving treatment compliance of patients. In the field of communicable diseases, especially those caused by intracellular bacteria, the delivery of antibiotics targeting specific cells is of critical importance to maximize their treatment efficacy. Brucella melitensis, an intracellular obligate bacterium surviving and replicating inside macrophages is hard to be eradicated, mainly because of the low ability of antibiotics to enter these phagocityc cells. Although different antibiotics regimens including gentamicin, doxycycline and rifampicin are in fact used against the Brucellosis, no efficient treatment has been attained yet, due to the intracellular life of the respective pathogen. Nano-medicines responding to environmental stimuli allow to maximize drug delivery targeting macropages, thereby boosting treatment efficacy. Several drug delivery nano-technologies, including solid lipid nanoparticles, liposomes, chitosan, niosomes, and their combinations with chitosan sodium alginate can be employed in combination of antibiotics to successfully eradicate Brucellosis infection from patients.","['Imam Hossein University', 'Chinese University of Hong Kong', 'University Health Agency Giuliano-Isontina (ASUGI)', 'Università degli Studi di Trieste', 'Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences']","['Italy', 'Hong Kong', 'Iran']","['Zhao S.', 'Razei A.', 'Cegolon L.', 'Saadati M.', 'Javanbakht M.', 'Keihan A.H.', 'Asadi M.', 'Hajizade A.', 'Aghamollaei H.', 'Khafaei M.', 'Heiat M.']","['Brucella', 'Drug delivery systems', 'Nanoparticles', 'Nanotechnology', 'Survival', 'Therapeutics']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Review,0,186.0,
Targeting kinase ITK treats autoimmune arthritis via orchestrating T cell differentiation and function,"© 2023 The AuthorsIL-2 inducible T cell kinase (ITK) is critical in T helper subset differentiation and its inhibition has been suggested for the treatment of T cell-mediated inflammatory diseases. T follicular helper (Tfh), Th17 and regulatory T cells (Treg) also play important roles in the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), while the role of ITK in the development of RA and the intricate balance between effector T and regulatory T cells remains unclear. Here, we found that CD4+ T cells from RA patients presented with an elevated ITK activation. ITK inhibitor alleviated existing collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and reduced antigen specific antibody production. Blocking ITK kinase activity interferes Tfh cell generation. Moreover, ITK inhibitor effectively rebalances Th17 and Treg cells by regulating Foxo1 translocation. Furthermore, we identified dihydroartemisinin (DHA) as a potential ITK inhibitor, which could inhibit PLC-γ1 phosphorylation and the progression of CIA by rebalancing Th17 and Treg cells. Out data imply that ITK activation is upregulated in RA patients, and therefore blocking ITK signal may provide an effective strategy to treat RA patients and highlight the role of ITK on the Tfh induction and RA progression.","['Shandong First Medical University &amp; Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences', 'School of Veterinary Medicine', 'Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine', 'Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine', 'Penn State Health Milton S.

Microtubule-destabilizing agents enhance STING-mediated innate immune response via biased mechanism in human monocyte cells,"© 2023 The AuthorsThe stimulator of the interferon gene (STING) signaling pathway acts as a primary defense system against DNA pathogens. Because of the crucial role of STING in type I interferon (IFN) response and innate immunity, extensive research has been conducted to elucidate the roles of various effector molecules involved in STING-mediated signal transduction. However, despite the substantial contribution of microtubules to the immune system, the association between the STING signaling pathway and microtubules remains unclear. In this study, we revealed that the modulation of STING via microtubule-destabilizing agents (MDAs) specifically induced type I IFN responses rather than inflammatory responses in human monocytes. Co-treatment of MDAs with STING agonists induced the elevation of phospho-TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), amplifying the innate immune response. However, during the deficiency of TBK1, the non-canonical signaling pathway through nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) contributed to MDA-induced STING activation in type I IFN response which suggested the versatile regulation of MDA in STING-mediated immunity.","['Korea Institute of Science and Technology', 'Ajou University', 'Korea Research Institute Chemical Technology', 'Hanyang University']",['South Korea'],"['Chu Y.', 'Jung H.R.', 'Kim H.', 'Lim S.', 'Lee S.', 'Lee H.', 'Kim E.']","['Microtubule', 'Pro-inflammatory response', 'Stimulator of interferon genes (STING)', 'Type I interferon response']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Article,0,77.0,2023
Inhibition of EphA2 protects against atherosclerosis by synergizing with statins to mitigate macrophage inflammation,"© 2023 The AuthorsStatins are highly prevalent in patients with coronary artery disease. Statins exert their anti-inflammatory effects on the vascular wall and circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, increasing attention revealed the exacerbation of macrophage inflammation induced by statins, and a clear mechanistic explanation of whether the detrimental effects of statins on macrophage inflammatory phenotypes outweigh the beneficial effects is has not yet been established. Here, RNA-sequencing and RT-qPCR analyses demonstrated that statins significantly upregulated EphA2, Nlrp3, IL-1β and TNF-α expression in macrophages. Mechanistically, we found that atorvastatin reduced KLF4 binding to the EphA2 promoter using KLF4-chromatin immunoprecipitation, suppressed HDAC11-mediated deacetylation and subsequently led to enhanced EphA2 transcription. The 4D-label-free proteomics analysis further confirmed the upregulated EphA2 and inflammatory signals. Furthermore, the proinflammatory effect of atorvastatin was neutralized by an addition of recombinant Fc-ephrinA1, a selective Eph receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ALW-II-41–27) or EphA2-silencing adenovirus (siEphA2). In vivo, EphA2 was identified a proatherogenic factor and apoE-/- mice placed on a high-fat diet following gastric gavage with atorvastatin exhibited a consistent elevation in EphA2 expression. We further observed that the transfection with siEphA2 in atorvastatin-treated mice significantly attenuated atherosclerotic plaque formation and abrogated statin-orchestrated macrophages proinflammatory genes expression as compared to that in atorvastatin alone. Increased plaque stability index was also observed following the addition of siEphA2, as evidenced by increased collagen and smooth muscle content and diminished lipid accumulation and macrophage infiltration. The data suggest that blockage of EphA2 provides an additional therapeutic benefit for further improving the anti-atherogenic effects of statins.","['Southern Medical University', 'Southwest Jiaotong University', 'University of Electronic Science and Technology of China']",['China'],"['Luo T.', 'Huang H.', 'Xiong Y.', 'Xiong S.', 'Wu Q.', 'Lu C.', 'Zhang Z.', 'Zeng J.']","['Atherosclerosis', 'Ephrin type-A receptor 2', 'Macrophage inflammation', 'Statins']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Article,0,36.0,2023
"FOXO1, a tiny protein with intricate interactions: Promising therapeutic candidate in lung cancer","© 2023 The AuthorsNowadays, lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women globally. Despite the development of extremely efficient targeted agents, lung cancer progression and drug resistance remain serious clinical issues. Increasing knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying progression and drug resistance will enable the development of novel therapeutic methods. It has been revealed that transcription factors (TF) dysregulation, which results in considerable expression modifications of genes, is a generally prevalent phenomenon regarding human malignancies. The forkhead box O1 (FOXO1), a member of the forkhead transcription factor family with crucial roles in cell fate decisions, is suggested to play a pivotal role as a tumor suppressor in a variety of malignancies, especially in lung cancer. FOXO1 is involved in diverse cellular processes and also has clinical significance consisting of cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, DNA repair, oxidative stress, cancer prevention, treatment, and chemo/radioresistance. Based on the critical role of FOXO1, this transcription factor appears to be an appropriate target for future drug discovery in lung cancers. This review focused on the signaling pathways, and molecular mechanisms involved in FOXO1 regulation in lung cancer. We also discuss pharmacological compounds that are currently being administered for lung cancer treatment by affecting FOXO1 and also point out the essential role of FOXO1 in drug resistance. Future preclinical research should assess combination drug strategies to stimulate FOXO1 and its upstream regulators as potential strategies to treat resistant or advanced lung cancers.","['University of Isfahan', 'Faculty of Medicine', 'Drug Applied Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences', 'Tabriz University of Medical Sciences', 'Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences', 'Urmia University of Medical Sciences', 'Islamic Azad University, Urmia Branch']",['Iran'],"['Ebrahimnezhad N.', 'Majidinia M.', 'Ebrahimnezhad M.', 'Bakhtiari G.H.', 'Natami M.', 'Yousefi B.', 'Tabnak P.']","['FOXO1', 'Lung cancer', 'NcRNAs', 'Signaling pathways', 'Transcription factors']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Review,0,127.0,2023

Metabolomic analysis found that pipecolic acid plays an important role in this process. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice and high-glucose cultured human retinal capillary endothelial cells (HRCECs) were then treated with pipecolic acid. Several oxidative stress measurements and RNA sequencing of retinal cells were tested. A gene interaction study was conducted using bioinformatics. Comparison of serological metabolites between healthy volunteers and DR patients showed that pipecolic acid was significantly lower in DR patients, and there was a negative correlation between the level of pipecolic acid with blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin. Yes-associated protein (YAP) mRNA, Malondialdehyde (MDA), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were significantly higher in diabetic mice, but glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) levels were significantly lower. Pipecolic acid significantly alleviated oxidative stress and YAP expression. The number of vascular tubes was significantly higher in the DR group, and pipecolic acid treatment significantly reduced tube formation. RNA-Sequencing analysis revealed that YAP and glutathione-dependent lipid hydroperoxidase glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) expression was reduced, and functional enrichment analysis revealed that ferroptosis and Hippo signaling pathways play an important role in this process. Additionally, pipecolic acid's ability to improve DR is diminished after YAP and GPX4 ablation. This study found that pipecolic acid, as a metabolite, may impede the progression of DR by inhibiting the YAP-GPX4 signaling pathway.","['National Clinical Research Center for Eye Diseases', 'Xuzhou Medical University', 'Tongren Hospital Shanghai Jiao Tong University School Of Medicine', 'Tongji University School of Medicine', 'Shanghai General Hospital']",['China'],"['Cai Y.', 'Guan Z.', 'Qiu Q.', 'Gong Y.', 'Luo L.', 'Jiang Y.', 'Jin X.', 'Lai D.', 'Cai C.']","['Diabetic retinopathy', 'Ferroptosis', 'GPX4', 'Pipecolic acid', 'YAP']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Article,0,35.0,2021
The paths and challenges of “off-the-shelf” CAR-T cell therapy: An overview of clinical trials,"© 2023 The AuthorsThe advent of chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells) has made a tremendous revolution in the era of cancer immunotherapy, so that since 2017 eight CAR-T cell products have been granted marketing authorization. All of these approved products are generated from autologous sources, but this strategy faces several challenges such as time-consuming and expensive manufacturing process and reduced anti-tumor potency of patients’ T cells due to the disease or previous therapies. The use of an allogeneic source can overcome these issues and provide an industrial, scalable, and standardized manufacturing process that reduces costs and provides faster treatment for patients. Nevertheless, for using allogeneic CAR-T cells, we are faced with the challenge of overcoming two formidable impediments: severe life-threatening graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD) caused by allogeneic CAR-T cells, and allorejection of allogeneic CAR-T cells by host immune cells which is called “host versus graft” (HvG). In this study, we reviewed recent registered clinical trials of allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy to analyze different approaches to achieve a safe and efficacious “off-the-shelf” source for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) based immunotherapy.","['School of Allied Medical Sciences', 'Digestive Diseases Research Institute']",['Iran'],"['Moradi V.', 'Omidkhoda A.', 'Ahmadbeigi N.']","['Allogeneic', 'CAR (chimeric Antigen Receptor)', 'Clinical', 'GvHD', 'Off-the-shelf', 'Trials']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Review,0,159.0,2023
The Effect of Hypnotherapy on the Pain Intensity of Endometriosis Patients Treated with Dienogest: A Pilot Double-Blind Randomized Clinical Trial,"© 2023, Author(s).Background: Endometriosis is a chronic disease in women of reproductive age accompanied by chronic pelvic pain and painful intercourse. It has a severe negative impact on these patients’ psychosocial parameters. The noninvasive treatment of endometriosis remains challenging. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of hypnotherapy on the pain intensity of endometriosis patients treated with dienogest. Methods: In this preliminary study (a pilot double-blind, randomized clinical trial), conducted from November 2021 to July 2022, 22 patients (18 to 45 years old) with endometriosis treated with dienogest in Shahid Akbar Abadi Hospital (Tehran, Iran) were enrolled. Via block randomization, they were divided into a control group and an intervention group (n = 11 each). The patients of both groups were given 2 mg of dienogest tablets daily as prescribed by the gynecologist. The main intervention involved hypnotherapy, which was administered only for the intervention group individually for 8 weekly sessions online (on WhatsApp) for 30-45 minutes. Dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and chronic pelvic pain were evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS) at the beginning of the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and 4 weeks after the intervention in both groups. Mean, standard deviation, frequency, chi-square, Fisher’s exact test, Mann-Whitney U, and Friedman test were used for data analysis. Results: Dysmenorrhea severity score in the intervention group was 6.30 ± 1.25 before the intervention, 5.50 ± 1.08 after the intervention, and 4.60 ± 0.97 during the follow-up, and the changes were significant (P < 0.001, effect size = 0.93). Dyspareunia severity score was 3.14 ± 4.50 before the intervention, 2.91 ± 4.30 after the intervention, and 2.42 ± 3.50 during the follow-up. These changes were also significant (P = 0.015, effect size = 0.41). However, the pelvic pain score did not significantly change despite the average decrease of 0.2 during the follow-up (P = 0.135). Conclusions: Hypnotherapy, along with drug treatment, was more effective in relieving endometriosis pain than drug treatment alone.","['Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center MAZUMS', 'Bank-e-Melli Iran Hospital', 'Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences']",['Iran'],"['Shahhosseini Z.', 'Shahriyaripoor R.', 'Ganji J.', 'Hoseinnezhad Z.', 'Pourasghar M.']","['Dienogest', 'Dysmenorrhea', 'Dyspareunia', 'Endometriosis', 'Hypnotherapy', 'Pain']",Journal of Nursing and Midwifery Sciences,Brieflands,['Nursing (all)'],['NURS'],Article,0,34.0,2023
Mesenchymal stem cell conditioned medium alleviates acute lung injury through KGF-mediated regulation of epithelial sodium channels,"© 2023 The AuthorsAcute lung injury (ALI) is a progressive inflammatory injury, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be used to treat ALI. MSC-conditioned medium (MSC-CM) contains many cytokines, in which keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) is a soluble factor that plays a role in lung development. We aim to explore the protective effects of MSCs secreted KGF on ALI, and investigate the involvement of epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), which are important in alveolar fluid reabsorption. Both lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced mouse and alveolar organoid ALI models were established to confirm the potential therapeutic effect of MSCs secreted KGF. Meanwhile, the expression and regulation of ENaC were determined in alveolar type II epithelial (ATII) cells. The results demonstrated that MSC-CM and KGF could alleviate the extent of inflammation-related pulmonary edema in ALI mice, which was abrogated by a KGF neutralizing antibody. In an alveolar organoid ALI model, KGF in MSC-CM could improve the proliferation and decrease the differentiation of ATII cells. At the cellular level, the LPS-inhibited protein expression of ENaC could be reversed by KGF in MSC-CM. In addition, bioinformatics analysis and our experimental data provided the evidence that the NF-κB signaling pathway may be involved in the regulation of ENaC. Our research confirmed that the therapeutic effect of MSC-CM on edematous ALI was closely related to KGF, which may be involved in the proliferation and differentiation of ATII cells, as well as the upregulation of ENaC expression by the inhibition of NF-κB signaling pathway.",['China Medical University Shenyang'],['China'],"['Fu Y.', 'Ding Y.', 'Xin S.', 'Nie H.', 'Yu T.', 'Hao L.', 'Cui Y.']","['Acute lung injury', 'Alveolar organoids', 'Epithelial sodium channels', 'Keratinocyte growth factor', 'Mesenchymal stem cells']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Article,0,52.0,2023
Veronica persica ameliorates acetaminophen-induced murine hepatotoxicity via attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation,"© 2023Excess acetaminophen (APAP) commonly causes severe acute liver injury (ALI), characterized by oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory responses, and hepatocyte damage. Veronica persica (VP) is a traditional medicine with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. There is a paucity of information on its medicinal value, especially its potential mechanisms for alleviating ALI. This study aimed to clarify the ameliorative effects and intracellular mechanisms of VP on APAP-induced ALI via attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation. Mice were given VP for 7 days before exposure to APAP (300 mg/kg). The HPLC and radical scavenging assay found that VP contains 12 phenolic acids and 6 flavonoids, as well as show robust antioxidant capacity. In the APAP-induced ALI model, pre-treatment with VP significantly reduces APAP-induced hepatotoxicity by observing improved hepatocyte pathological injury and further confirmed by serum biochemical indicator. Also, the reduction of TUNEL-positive regions and the regulation of Bcl-2-associated X protein indicated that VP attenuates hepatocytotoxicity. Moreover, VP pre-intervention inhibits the formation of liver pro-inflammatory cytokines, the expression of inflammatory response genes, and increases in myeloperoxidase (MPO) in APAP-exposed mice. The elevated reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and decreased oxidative stress markers indicate that VP reduces APAP-promoted oxidative stress. Further study revealed that VP inhibited the phosphorylation of NF-κB/STAT3 cascade, blocked ERK and JNK phosphorylation, and activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). To sum up, this study demonstrated that VP exists hepatoprotective abilities on APAP-induced ALI, primarily by suppressing the phosphorylation of NF-κB/STAT3 cascade and ERK-JNK and inducing AMPK activation to alleviate oxidative stress and inflammation.","['Jeonbuk National University', 'Henan University of Science and Technology', 'Jeonbuk National University, School of Medicine']","['South Korea', 'China']","['Hwang H.P.', 'Ahn D.', 'Tian W.-S.', 'Mao M.-X.', 'Zhao J.', 'Kim I.-S.', 'Tae H.-J.', 'Kim M.-K.', 'Park B.-Y.']","['Acetaminophen (APAP)', 'Acute liver injury (ALI)', 'AMPK', 'ERK-JNK', 'Oxidative stress', 'Veronica persica (VP)']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Article,0,54.0,
Effects of total flavones of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) on the treatment of diabetic nephropathy via the activation of solute carriers in renal tubular epithelial cells,"© 2023 The AuthorsAs a traditional Chinese medicine, Huangkui capsule (HKC) has been used to treat patients with kidney diseases, including diabetic nephropathy (DN). We have recently demonstrated that HKC could re-regulate the activities of solute carriers (SLC)s in proximal and distal convoluted tubules of kidneys in regression of the development of DN. The main active chemical constituents of HKC are the flavones of Abelmoschus manihot (L.). The current study aims to further evaluate the efficacy of total flavones of A. manihot (TFA) in the regression of DN by analyzing SLC activities in proximal and distal convoluted tubules of kidneys. TFA (0.076 g/kg/d) or vehicle was administered in db/db mice, the animal model of type 2 diabetes and DN, daily via oral gavage for four weeks. Blood glucose levels and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) were measured and used for the determination of T2D and DN. Ten SLCs, including slc2a2, slc4A1, slc5a2, slc5A3, slc5a8, slc6a20, slc27a2, slc12a3, slc34a1 and slc38a2 were highly expressed in proximal and distinct convoluted tubules of kidneys. Their expression at mRNA and protein levels before and after TFA treatment were analyzed with real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Data showed that UACR in the db/db mice after TFA treatment was significantly decreased. Compared with the group of non-diabetic control, slc2a2, slc4A1, slc5a2, slc5A3, slc5a8, slc6a20, slc27a2, slc12a3, slc34a1 and slc38a2 in the group of DN were down-regulated but up-regulated after TFA treatment. Further analyses of whole kidney sections indicated that the numbers and structures of the nephron in db/db mice was increased and improved after TFA treatment. Thereby, the current study provides further evidence that the flavones in A. manihot have pharmacological effects on the treatment of DN by improving the biological function of SLCs in kidneys.","['China Pharmaceutical University', 'Suzhong Pharmaceutical Research Institute', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines', 'Nanjing Medical University']",['China'],"['Tang W.', 'Gu H.F.', 'Wang M.', 'Qiang L.', 'Xu Q.', 'Yu J.', 'Tang H.', 'Yu H.', 'Ge H.']","['Abelmoschus manihot (L.)', 'Diabetic nephropathy', 'Solute carriers', 'Type 2 diabetes']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Article,0,29.0,2023
Cell-based mechanisms and strategies of co-culture system both in vivo and vitro for bone tissue engineering,"© 2023 The AuthorsThe lack of a functional vascular supply has been identified as a major challenge limiting the clinical introduction of stem cell-based bone tissue engineering (BTE) for the repair of large-volume bone defects (LVBD). Various approaches have been explored to improve the vascular supply in tissue-engineered constructs, and the development of strategies that could effectively induce the establishment of a functional vascular supply has become a major goal of BTE research. One of the state-of-the-art methods is to incorporate both angiogenic and osteogenic cells in co-culture systems. This review clarifies the key concepts involved, summarises the cell types and models used to date, and systematically evaluates their performance. We also discuss the cell-to-cell communication between these two cell types and the strategies explored in BTE constructs with angiogenic and osteogenic cells to optimise their functions. In addition, we outline unresolved issues and remaining obstacles that need to be overcome for further development in this field and eventual successful repair of LVBD.","['Academisch Centrum Tandheelkunde Amsterdam', 'Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam', 'Ruijin Hospital', ""Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine"", 'Tongji University']","['China', 'Netherlands']","['Wu G.', 'Li Q.', 'Yu T.', 'Bi M.', 'Yang K.']","['Bone defect', 'Co-culture system', 'Osteogenesis', 'Tissue engineering']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Review,0,223.0,2023
NTRK1-mediated protection against manganese-induced neurotoxicity and cell apoptosis via IGF2 in SH-SY5Y cells,"© 2023 The AuthorsBackground: Excessive manganese (Mn) exposure has been linked to neurotoxicity, cognitive impairments. Neurotrophic Receptor Kinase 1 (NTRK1) encodes Tropomyosin kinase A (TrkA), a neurotrophic receptor, as a mediator of neuron differentiation and survival. Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), a pivotal member of the insulin gene family, plays a crucial role in brain development and neuroprotection. Despite this knowledge, the precise mechanisms through which NTRK1 and IGF2 influence cell responses to Mn-induced neuronal damage remain elusive. Methods: Cell apoptosis was assessed using CCK8, TUNEL staining, and Western blot analysis of cleaved Caspase-3. Lentiviral vectors facilitated NTRK1 overexpression, while small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) facilitated IGF2 knockdown. Real-time Quantitative PCR (qPCR) determined gene expression levels, while Western blotting measured protein expression. Results: The study reveals that NTRK1 inhibits MnCl2-induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. NTRK1 overexpression significantly upregulated IGF2 expression, and subsequent siRNA-IGF2 experiments confirmed IGF2's pivotal role in NTRK1-mediated neuroprotection. Notably, the study identifies that NTRK1 regulates the expression of IGF2 in the neuroprotective mechanism with the involvement of ER stress pathways. Discussion: The study reveals NTRK1's neuroprotective role via IGF2 against Mn-induced neurotoxicity and ER stress modulation in SH-SY5Y cells. These findings offer insights into potential therapies for neurodegenerative disorders related to Mn exposure and NTRK1 dysfunction, driving future research in this domain.","['Huazhong University of Science and Technology', 'Wuhan University']",['China'],"['Jiao B.', 'Zhang X.', 'Zhang C.', 'Cao X.', 'Zhang K.', 'Yu S.', 'Zhang M.', 'Zhang W.']","['Apoptosis', 'ER stress', 'IGF2', 'MnCl2', 'NTRK1', 'SH-SY5Y cell']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Article,0,74.0,2023
Influence of unsaturated fatty acids on the antitumor activity of polymeric conjugates grafted with cabazitaxel against prostate cancer,"© 2023 The AuthorsCabazitaxel (CTX) is a medication used for treating metastatic prostate cancer. However, its effectiveness is majorly limited by its poor water solubility and lack of tumor targeting. In this study, three unsaturated fatty acids, GLA, ALA and DHA, were separately connected with CTX and then covalently attached to bifunctionalized dextran through a linker to produce three dual drug conjugates named dextran-GLA-CTX, dextran-ALA-CTX and dextran-DHA-CTX. The three conjugates displayed enhanced solubility of CTX in water and improved antitumor effects compared to the conventional CTX formulation. The results also confirmed that dextran-GLA-CTX exhibited the strongest antitumor activity, while dextran-DHA-CTX displayed less efficacy, as evaluated through xenografted nude mice bearing PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells. Additionally, dextran-GLA-CTX showed greater inhibition of tumor growth than dextran-CTX. Moreover, the dextran-GLA-CTX conjugate was found to prolong the half-life of CTX in plasma and selectively accumulate in tumors. This study revealed that unsaturated fatty acids can enhance the antitumor activity of dextran-based conjugates grafted with CTX.","['Santolecan Pharmaceuticals LLC', 'National Glycoengineering Research Center']","['United States', 'China']","['Dong P.', 'Shi Y.', 'Jia W.', 'Liu J.', 'Li X.', 'Zhao L.', 'Wang S.', 'Hu J.', 'Lv H.', 'Yang L.']","['Alpha-linolenic acid', 'Cabazitaxel', 'Conjugate', 'Dextran', 'Docosahexaenoic acid', 'Gamma-linolenic acid']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Article,0,65.0,2023
Discussing pathologic mechanisms of Diabetic retinopathy & therapeutic potentials of curcumin and β-glucogallin in the management of Diabetic retinopathy,"© 2023 The AuthorsDiabetic retinopathy (DR) is a form of retinal microangiopathy that occurs as a result of long-term Diabetes mellitus (DM). Patients with Diabetes mellitus typically suffer from DR as a progression of the disease that may be due to initiation and dysregulation of pathways like the polyol, hexosamine, the AGE/RAGE, and the PKC pathway, which all have negative impacts on eye health and vision. In this review, various databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Science Direct, were scoured for data relevant to the aforementioned title. The three most common therapies for DR today are retinal photocoagulation, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy, and vitrectomy, however, there are a number of drawbacks and limits to these methods. So, it is of critical importance and profound interest to discover treatments that may successfully address the pathogenesis of DR. Curcumin and β-glucogallin are the two potent compounds of natural origin that are already being used in various nutraceutical formulations for several ailments. They have been shown potent antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, and pro-vascular function benefits in animal experiments. Their parent plant species have been used for generations by practitioners of traditional herbal medicine for the treatment and prevention of various eye ailments.

Carboxylated Pocoa polysaccharides inhibited oxidative damage and inflammation of HK-2 cells induced by calcium oxalate nanoparticles,"© 2023 The AuthorsThe inhibitory effects of Chinese medicine Pocoa (PCPs) with different carboxyl group (-COOH) contents on oxidative damage and inflammatory response of renal epithelial cells and the influence of -COOH content in polysaccharides were investigated. HK-2 cell damage model was established by nanocalcium oxalate crystals (nanoCOM), and then PCPs with -COOH contents of 2.56% (PCP0), 7.48% (PCP1), 12.07% (PCP2), and 17.18% (PCP3) were used to protect the cells. PCPs could inhibit the damage of nanoCOM to HK-2 cells, increase cell viability, restore cytoskeleton and morphology, and improve lysosomal integrity. PCPs can reduce the oxidative stress response of nanoCOM to cells, inhibit the opening of mPTP and cell necrotic apoptosis, reduce the level of Ca2+ ions in cells, the production of ATP and MDA, and increase SOD expression. PCPs can also reduce the cellular inflammatory response caused by oxidative damage, and reduce the expression of nitric oxide (NO), inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and MCP-1, as well as the content of inflammasome NLRP3. After protection, PCPs can inhibit the endocytosis of nanoCOM crystals by cells. With the increase in -COOH content in PCPs, its ability to inhibit nanoCOM cell damage, reduce oxidative stress, reduce inflammatory response, and inhibit crystal endocytosis increases, that is, PCP3 with the highest -COOH content, shows the best biological activity. Inhibiting cell damage and inflammation and reducing a large amount of endocytosis of crystals by cells are beneficial to inhibit the formation of kidney stones.","['Institute of Biomineralization and Lithiasis Research', 'Jinan University']",['China'],"['Zheng Y.-Y.', 'Ouyang J.-M.', 'Xiong P.']","['Anti-inflammation', 'Carboxymethylated polysaccharide', 'Cytoendocytosis', 'Nanocrystals', 'Oxidative damage']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Article,0,115.0,2023
Advances and challenges in the treatment of lung cancer,"© 2023 The AuthorsLung cancer accounts for a relatively high proportion of malignant tumors. As the most prevalent type of lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is characterized by high morbidity and mortality. Presently, the arsenal of treatment strategies encompasses surgical resection, chemotherapy, targeted therapy and radiotherapy. However, despite these options, the prognosis remains distressingly poor with a low 5-year survival rate. Therefore, it is urgent to pursue a paradigm shift in treatment methodologies. In recent years, the advent of sophisticated biotechnologies and interdisciplinary integration has provided innovative approaches for the treatment of lung cancer. This article reviews the cutting-edge developments in the nano drug delivery system, molecular targeted treatment system, photothermal treatment strategy, and immunotherapy for lung cancer.

Tetrahydropalmatine: Orchestrating survival – Regulating autophagy and apoptosis via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in perforator flaps,"© 2023 The AuthorsBackground: Introduced in clinical practice in 1989, perforator flaps are vital for tissue defect repair, but they are challenged by distal necrosis. Tetrahydropalmatine (THP) from celandine is renowned for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. This study investigates THP's use in perforator flaps. Methods: Thirty rats were divided into a control group and four THP concentration groups, while seventy-eight rats were categorized as control, THP, THP combined with rapamycin (RAP), and RAP alone. We created 11 cm by 2.5 cm multi-regional perforator flaps on rat backs, assessing survival blood flow and extracting skin flap tissue for autophagy, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and angiogenesis markers. Results: The THP group exhibited significantly reduced distal necrosis, increased blood flow density, and survival area on the seventh day compared to controls. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot results demonstrated improved anti-oxidative stress and angiogenesis markers, along with decreased autophagy and apoptosis indicators. Combining THP with RAP diminished flap survival compared to THP alone. This was supported by protein expression changes in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Conclusion: THP enhances flap survival by modulating autophagy, reducing tissue edema, promoting angiogenesis, and mitigating apoptosis and oxidative stress. THP offers a potential strategy for enhancing multi-regional perforator flap survival through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. These findings highlight THP's promise in combatting perforator flap necrosis, uncovering a novel mechanism for its impact on flap survival.","['Wenzhou Medical University', ""The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University"", 'Key Laboratory of Orthopaedics of Zhejiang Province', 'School of Laboratory Medicine and Life Science']",['China'],"['Jiang R.', 'Gao W.', 'Huang S.', 'Chen X.', 'Li S.', 'Fu K.', 'Huang Y.', 'Wu H.', 'Wang A.', 'Dong C.', 'Li G.', 'Lai Y.', 'Shen L.', 'Chen Z.']","['Angiogenesis', 'Apoptosis', 'Autophagy', 'Multi-territory perforator flap', 'Oxidative stress', 'Tetrahydropalmatine']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Article,0,62.0,2023
"Irinotecan cause the side effects on development and adult physiology, and induces intestinal damage via innate immune response and oxidative damage in Drosophila","© 2023Chemotherapy leads to significant side effects in patients, especially in the gut, resulting in various clinical manifestations and enhanced economic pressure. Until now, many of the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we used Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) as in vivo model to delineate the side effects and underlying mechanisms of Irinotecan (CPT-11). The results showed that administration of CPT-11 delayed larval development, induced imbalance of male to female ratio in offspring, shortened lifespan, impaired locomotor ability, changed metabolic capacity, induced ovarian atrophy, and increased excretion. Further, CPT-11 supplementation dramatically caused intestinal damages, including decreased intestinal length, increased crop size, disrupted gastrointestinal acid-based homeostasis, induced epithelial cell death, and damaged the ultrastructure and mitochondria structure of epithelial cells. The cross-comparative analysis between transcriptome and bioinformation results showed that CPT-11 induced intestinal damage mainly via regulating the Toll-like receptor signaling, NF-kappa B signaling, MAPK signaling, FoxO signaling, and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways. In addition, CPT-11 led to the intestinal damage by increasing ROS accumulation. These observations raise the prospects of using Drosophila as a model for the rapid and systemic evaluation of chemotherapy-induced side effects and high-throughput screening of the protective drugs.","[""Gansu Province People's Hospital"", 'Gansu University of Chinese Medicine']",['China'],"['Cai H.', 'Xiu M.', 'Li Y.', 'Liu Y.', 'Wang Y.', 'Wang X.', 'Su Y.', 'Han S.', 'Kang Q.', 'He J.']","['Chemotherapy', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Intestine', 'Irinotecan', 'Side effects']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Article,0,78.0,
Insights into the Notch signaling pathway in degenerative musculoskeletal disorders: Mechanisms and perspectives,"© 2023 The AuthorsDegenerative musculoskeletal disorders are a group of age-related diseases of the locomotive system that severely affects the patient's ability to work and cause adverse sequalae such as fractures and even death. The incidence and prevalence of degenerative musculoskeletal disorders is rising owing to the aging of the world's population. The Notch signaling pathway, which is expressed in almost all organ systems, extensively regulates cell proliferation and differentiation as well as cellular fate. Notch signaling shows increased activity in degenerative musculoskeletal disorders and retards the progression of degeneration to some extent. The review focuses on four major degenerative musculoskeletal disorders (osteoarthritis, intervertebral disc degeneration, osteoporosis, and sarcopenia) and summarizes the pathophysiological functions of Notch signaling in these disorders, especially its role in stem/progenitor cells in each disorder.

Polycomb repressor complex: Its function in human cancer and therapeutic target strategy,"© 2023 The AuthorsThe Polycomb Repressor Complex (PRC) plays a pivotal role in gene regulation during development and disease, with dysregulation contributing significantly to various human cancers. The intricate interplay between PRC and cellular signaling pathways sheds light on cancer complexity. PRC presents promising therapeutic opportunities, with inhibitors undergoing rigorous evaluation in preclinical and clinical studies. In this review, we emphasize the critical role of PRC complex in gene regulation, particularly PcG proteins mediated chromatin compaction through phase separation. We also highlight the pathological implications of PRC complex dysregulation in various tumors, elucidating underlying mechanisms driving cancer progression. The burgeoning field of therapeutic strategies targeting PRC complexes, notably EZH2 inhibitors, has advanced significantly. However, we explore the need for combination therapies to enhance PRC targeted treatments efficacy, providing a glimpse into the future of cancer therapeutics.","['Ganjiang Chinese Medicine Innovation Center', 'Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences']",['China'],"['Liang X.', 'Chen Y.', 'Liu J.', 'Fan H.']","['Cancer progression', 'Epigenetic modification', 'Polycomb repressor complex', 'Therapeutic target', 'Tumorigenesis']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Review,0,219.0,2023
The mitochondrial regulation in ferroptosis signaling pathway and its potential strategies for cancer,"© 2023 The AuthorsFerroptosis is an iron-dependent regulated cell death, mainly manifested by the production of reactive oxygen species and accumulation of lipid peroxides. It is distinct from other forms of cell death with regard to morphology and biochemistry, particularly in disrupting mitochondrial function. Mitochondria are essential compartments where the organism generates energy and are closely associated with the fate of ferroptosis. Currently, researchers focus on the potential value of ferroptosis and mitochondria for overcoming drug sensitivity and assisting in cancer therapy. In this review, we summarize the main mechanisms of ferroptosis (the GPX4-realated pathway, FSP1-related pathway, and iron metabolism pathway) and the functions and regulating pathways of mitochondria (the TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial regulation of iron ions, and mtDNA) in ferroptosis. We believe that exploring the role of mitochondria in ferroptosis will help us understand the potential regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis in cancer and help us find new therapeutic targets.","['Qingdao University', 'Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University']",['China'],"['Gao L.', 'Zhou X.', 'Sun K.', 'Li S.', 'Ren W.', 'Zhi Y.', 'Zhi K.']","['Cancer therapeutic strategy', 'Cell death', 'Ferroptosis', 'Mitochondria', 'Molecular mechanism']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Review,0,97.0,2023
Acidification of the phagosome orchestrates the motor forces directing its transport,"© 2023 The AuthorsPhagosomes are dynamic organelles formed by macrophages to capture and destroy microbial pathogens. Phagosome transport from the cell periphery to the perinuclear region, is essential for fusion with lysosomes and the elimination of pathogens. Molecular motors, kinesin and dynein, generate opposing forces, transporting the phagosome away from and towards the lysosome, respectively. Luminal acidification plays a crucial role in determining the net directional movement of the phagosome. The mechanics of this regulation are not known. In this study, we used the sodium proton exchanger NHE9 to selectively modulate phagosomal acidification in macrophages. We then investigated its impact on the mechanical properties of kinesin and dynein motors through optical trapping experiments. We observed a negative correlation between the tenacity of dynein motors and pH under high resistive forces. Reduced luminal acidification impaired generation of dynein cooperative forces, which are crucial for transporting the phagosome to the lysosome. Conversely, the kinesin-powered motility of phagosomes is enabled by a decrease in phagosomal acidification. Given the various methods pathogens employ to limit phagosomal acidification, our findings are highly significant in the context of host-pathogen interactions.",['University of Michigan-Dearborn'],['United States'],"['Kondapalli K.C.', 'Bezih Z.', 'Shamroukh H.S.', 'Akhtar M.', 'Fares P.', 'Tripathy S.K.']",,Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Cell Biology', 'Biophysics']",['BIOC'],Article,0,23.0,2023
"Efficacy of digestive enzyme supplementation in functional dyspepsia: A monocentric, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial","© 2023 The AuthorsFunctional dyspepsia is a form of dyspepsia lacking in clear causes following clinical assessment. Dyspepsia is characterized by episodic or persistent abdominal pain or discomfort of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Its onset has been linked with a deficiency or dysfunction of digestive enzymes. Thus, consumption of digestive multi-enzymatic preparations may be effectively used for the reduction of symptoms. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness and tolerability of the supplementation of a normal diet with a multi-enzyme blend obtained from fungal fermentation, in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, clinical trial. Enrolled subjects (n = 120, male: 63, female: 57), aged 18–59 years, were randomized (allocation ratio 1:1) to receive either 2 capsules per day of the food supplement (containing 200 mg of the multi-enzyme blend/capsule) or placebo, for 2 months. The primary outcome of the study (i.e., improvements in quality of life) was evaluated by the Nepean Dyspepsia Index-SF (NDI-SF) questionnaire, while the secondary outcomes (i.e., severity of pain and the quality of sleep) were assessed through the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. The results showed an improvement in NDI-SF1, NDI-SF2–5, VAS, and PSQI scores in subjects treated with the multi-enzyme blend, indicating an improvement in quality of life and of sleep, and a decreased severity of pain, following the supplementation with digestive enzymes, without side effects. In conclusion, treatment with digestive enzymes was found to be effective in the reduction of functional dyspepsia symptoms and in the improvement of sleep quality, and is well-tolerated.","['Islamic University of Madinah', 'Jiangsu University', 'CEINGE-Biotecnologie Avanzate S.c.a r.l.', 'Università degli Studi di Pavia', 'Società Cooperativa Sociale di Medici di Medicina Generale', 'Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II', 'Level 1 Medical Director Anaesthesia and Resuscitation A.

Combined analytical assays for the characterization of drugs binding to human IgE: Applicability to omalizumab-bearing biosimilar candidates assessment,"© 2023Analytical and functional comparison is key for substantiating the level of convergence (essential sameness) or divergence between versions or variants of a given biological medicine. Accordingly, an overlapping biological activity between products meant to be equal probably reflects a highly similar structure and anticipates a comparable pharmacodynamic behavior. We developed an orthogonal approach to compare the human IgE binding features of different lots and versions of Xolair® (omalizumab), an anti-human IgE monoclonal antibody. The IgE binding affinity and kinetics were measured by surface plasmon resonance. Ability to prevent mast cell activity was assessed in vitro and in vivo in mast cell-based models. The variability of monoclonal antibodies with identical amino acid sequences produced either in Chinese hamster ovarian cells or in human HEK293 cells, was compared. Monoclonal antibodies from the two sources exhibited slightly different human IgE binding and neutralizing features. A known variant exhibiting a three amino acid replacement in the Fab region had lower IgE binding affinity than the original omalizumab. The lower binding affinity translated into reduced IgE neutralizing capacity and, in turn, a difference in the ability to prevent mast cell activation in vitro and in vivo. The proposed set of analytical and functional assays was sensitive enough to detect Fab-linked differences between anti-IgE antibody versions exhibiting an identical aminoacid sequence. In addition to add value to the comparative assessment of biosimilar candidates bearing omalizumab, these methods can aid pre-assessments of new anti-IgE agents that aim to improve therapeutic performance.","['Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona', 'Universitat de Barcelona', 'Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Respiratorias']",['Spain'],"['de Mora F.', 'Urbano A.', 'Plaza J.', 'Picado C.']","['Anti-IgE', 'Biosimilar', 'Comparability', 'Immunoglobulin E', 'Omalizumab']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Article,0,37.0,
Securinega suffruticosa extract alleviates atopy-like lesions in NC/Nga mice via inhibition of the JAK1-STAT1/3 pathway,"© 2023 The AuthorsSecurinega suffruticosa (SS) has well-known antioxidant, anti-vascular inflammation, and anti-bone resorption effects; however, the effects of SS in atopic dermatitis (AD) remain unknown. We examined the effects of SS on AD via application of Dermatophagoides farinae extract (DfE) to the ears and skin of NC/Nga mice. As a result of SS administration, DfE-induced AD mice had reduced ear thickness, epidermal thickness, scratching behavior, and transepidermal water loss. The serum levels of immunoglobulin E and thymic interstitial lymphopoietin (TSLP) were reduced by SS application. SS decreased mast cell and eosinophil recruitment to skin lesions. Phosphorylation of signal transducer and activation of transcription (STAT)1, STAT3, and Janus kinase 1 were reduced in the skin tissue of SS-administered mice, and downregulated filaggrin was restored. SS reduced the levels of interleukin-6, regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted chemokine, and TSLP in interferon-γ/tumor necrosis factor-α–induced keratinocytes. The main components of SS were rutin and geraniin. These study results indicated that SS extract attenuated AD and has potential as a therapeutic natural product candidate for AD.","['University of Science and Technology (UST)', 'Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine']",['South Korea'],"['Kim D.-S.', 'Yuk H.J.', 'Kim M.', 'Min Y.', 'Sung Y.-Y.']","['Atopic dermatitis', 'Cytokines', 'Filaggrin', 'JAK-STAT signaling pathway', 'Keratinocyte', 'Securinega suffruticosa']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Article,0,50.0,2023
Irisin protected hemopoietic stem cells and improved outcome of severe bone marrow failure,"© 2023Acquired aplastic anemia (AA) is a bone marrow failure (BMF) disease, characterized by fatty bone marrow (BM) and BM hypocellularity resulted from auto-immune dysregulated T cells-mediated destruction of BM haemopoietic stem cells (HPSC). The objective of this study was to investigate potential therapeutic effect of irisin, a molecule involved in adipose tissue transition, on AA mouse model. Our results showed that the concentration of irisin in serum was lower in AA patients than in healthy controls, suggesting a role of irisin in the pathogenesis of AA. In the AA mice, irisin administration prolonged the survival rate, prevented or attenuated peripheral pancytopenia, and preserved HPSC in the BM. Moreover, irisin also markedly reduced BM adipogenesis. In vitro results showed that irisin increased both cell proliferation and colony numbers of HPSC. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that irisin upregulated the expression of mitochondrial ATPase Inhibitory Factor 1 (IF1) in HPSC, inhibited the activation of mitochondrial fission protein (DRP1) and enhanced aerobic glycolysis. Taken together, our findings indicate novel roles of irisin in the pathogenesis of AA, and in the protection of HPSC through stimulation of proliferation and regulation of mitochondria function, which provides a proof-of-concept for the application of irisin in AA therapy.","['Second Hospital of Shandong University', 'Karolinska Institutet', 'University of Florida College of Medicine', 'Shandong University', ""Qilu Children's Hospital of Shandong University"", 'Shandong Academy of Pharmaceutical Sciences']","['United States', 'China', 'Sweden']","['Li H.', 'Li X.', 'Feng X.', 'Hu J.', 'Liu X.', 'Donelan W.', 'Guo Y.', 'Li S.', 'Wang B.', 'Xu D.', 'Han Y.', 'Tang D.', 'Kong D.', 'Jiang Y.', 'Zhao Y.', 'Ren J.', 'Yang L.', 'Zheng C.', 'Xiao F.', 'Wang F.', 'Chen Y.']","['Aplastic anemia', 'Bone marrow failure', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'IF1', 'Irisin']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Article,0,36.0,
The role of SphK/S1P/S1PR signaling pathway in bone metabolism,"© 2023 The AuthorsThere are a large number of people worldwide who suffer from osteoporosis, which imposes a huge economic burden, so it is necessary to explore the underlying mechanisms to achieve better supportive and curative care outcomes. Sphingosine kinase (SphK) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the synthesis of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). S1P with paracrine and autocrine activities that act through its cell surface S1P receptors (S1PRs) and intracellular signals. In osteoporosis, S1P is indispensable for both normal and disease conditions. S1P has complicated roles in regulating osteoblast and osteoclast, respectively, and there have been exciting developments in understanding how SphK/S1P/S1PR signaling regulates these processes in response to osteoporosis therapy. Here, we review the proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and functions of S1P, specifically detailing the roles of S1P and S1PRs in osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Finally, we focus on the S1P‐based therapeutic approaches in bone metabolism, which may provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic strategies for osteoporosis.","['Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine', ""Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China"", 'Guangdong Pharmaceutical University', 'Guangdong TCM Key Laboratory for Metabolic Diseases']",['China'],"['Xu X.', 'Liu Y.', 'Luo D.', 'Fan F.', 'Wang X.', 'Zhu T.', 'Han Y.']","['Osteoporosis', 'Sphingosine-1–Phosphate', 'Sphingosine-1–Phosphate receptor', 'SphK/S1P/S1PR signaling pathway']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Review,0,107.0,2023
"Genetic polymorphisms in ADRB1, ADRB2 and CYP2D6 genes and response to beta-blockers in patients with acute coronary syndrome","© 2023Betablockers (BBs) are prescribed for ischaemia in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). In Spain, bisoprolol and carvedilol are the most prescribed BBs, but patients often had to discontinue them due to adverse effects. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ADRB1, ADRB2 and CYP2D6 genes have strong evidence of pharmacogenetic association with BBs in heart failure or hypertension, but the evidence in ACS is limited. Therefore, our study focuses on investigating how these genes influence the response to BBs in ACS patients. We analysed the association between SNPs in ADRB1 Gly389Arg (rs1801253) and Ser49Gly (rs1801252), ADRB2 Gly16Arg (rs1042713) and Glu27Gln (rs1042714), and CYP2D* 6 (*2– rs1080985, *4- rs3892097, *10 – rs1065852) and the occurrence of bradycardia/hypotension events during one year of follow-up. We performed an observational study and included 285 ACS-PCI-stent patients. A first analysis including patients treated with bisoprolol and a second analysis including patients treated with other BBs were performed. We found that the presence of the G allele (Glu) of the ADRB2 gene (rs1042714; Glu27Gln) conferred a protective effect against hypotension-induced by BBs; OR (CI 95%) = 0,14 (0,03−0,60), p < 0.01. The ADRB2 (rs1042713; Gly16Arg) GG genotype could also prevent hypotensive events; OR (CI 95%) = 0.49 (0.28–0.88), p = 0015. SNPs in ADRB1 and CYP2D6 * 2, CYP2D6 * 4 weren´t associated with primary events. The effect of CYP2D6 * 10 does not seem to be relevant for the response to BBs. According to our findings, SNPs in ADRB2 (rs1042713, rs1042714) could potentially affect the response and tolerance to BBs in ACS-patients. Further studies are necessary to clarify the impact of ADRB2 polymorphisms.","['Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Granada', 'Universidad de Granada', 'Universidad de Granada, Facultad de Medicina', 'Santa Bárbara Hospital']",['Spain'],"['Castano-Amores C.', 'Garcia-Rodriguez S.', 'Pozo-Agundo A.', 'Antunez-Rodriguez A.', 'Davila-Fajardo C.L.', 'Martinez-Gonzalez L.J.']","['Acute coronary syndrome', 'ADRB genes', 'Betablockers', 'Bisoprolol', 'CYP2D6 gene', 'Pharmacogenetic']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Article,0,63.0,0015
Kallikrein-related peptidase 10 predicts prognosis and mediates tumor immunomodulation in colorectal cancer,"© 2023 The AuthorsThe incidence and mortality rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) have significantly increased in recent years. It has been shown that early diagnosis of CRC improves the five-year survival of patients compared to late diagnosis, as patients with stage I disease have a five-year survival rate as high as 90 %. Through bioinformatics analysis, we identified Kallikrein 10 (KLK10), a member of the Kallikrein family, as a reliable predictor of CRC progression, particularly in patients with early-stage CRC. Furthermore, single-cell analysis revealed that KLK10 was highly expressed in tumor and partial immune cells. Analysis of the biological functions of KLK10 using the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes and gene ontology indicated that KLK10 plays a role in the proliferation and differentiation of cancer cells, along with the maintenance of tumor function and immune regulation, explicitly by T cells and macrophages. EdU cell proliferation staining, plate clone formation assay, and cell scratch assay demonstrated that KLK10 inhibition by siRNA affected the proliferation and migration of CRC cells. Cell cycle detection by flow cytometry demonstrated that KLK10 inhibition led to cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. In addition, the proportion of M1 and M2 macrophages in 45 tumor specimens was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, the proportion of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells in plasma was identified by flow cytometry, and their correlation with KLK10 was analyzed. The effects of KLK10 on T cells and macrophages were verified in independent cell experiments. The results revealed that KLK10 also activates CD4+ T cells, mediating M2-type macrophage polarization.","['Key Laboratory of Blood-stasis-toxin Syndrome of Zhejiang Province', 'Hunan University of Chinese Medicine', 'Zhejiang Chinese Medical University', 'Tongde Hospital of Zhejiang Province']",['China'],"['Jiang T.', 'Lv Y.-L.', 'Shi X.-X.', 'He R.-X.', 'Luo Y.-C.']","['Colorectal cancer', 'KLK10', 'KLKs', 'Macrophages', 'T cells', 'Tumor immunity']",Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Cell Biology', 'Biophysics']",['BIOC'],Article,0,36.0,2023
"The recent advances in cell delivery approaches, biochemical and engineering procedures of cell therapy applied to coronary heart disease","© 2023 The AuthorsCell therapy is an important topic in the field of regeneration medicine that is gaining attention within the scientific community. However, its potential for treatment in coronary heart disease (CHD) has yet to be established. Several various strategies, types of cells, routes of distribution, and supporting procedures have been tried and refined to trigger heart rejuvenation in CHD. However, only a few of them result in a real considerable promise for clinical usage. In this review, we give an update on techniques and clinical studies of cell treatment as used to cure CHD that are now ongoing or have been completed in the previous five years. We also highlight the emerging efficacy of stem cell treatment for CHD. We specifically examine and comment on current breakthroughs in cell treatment applied to CHD, including the most effective types of cells, transport modalities, engineering, and biochemical approaches used in this context.

In-situ/operando characterization of FeOx-based chemiresistive sensor of acetone vapours by X-ray absorption spectroscopy,"© 2023 The AuthorsMetal oxide thin films are archetypal active elements employed in chemiresistive gas sensors. Most existing metal oxide-based sensors operate at elevated temperatures; however, the sensing mechanism has generally been deduced considering the room-temperature properties of metal oxide compounds. We report an in-operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy study on a chemiresistive sensor of acetone vapours; namely, the chemical structure of iron-oxide nanoparticles (NPs) exposed to trace concentrations of acetone vapours under varying temperature conditions was examined. Our results show that the iron-oxide NPs, identified as maghemite/magnetite (γ-Fe2O3/Fe3O4) compound, partially reduced with temperature. Likewise, the iron oxide NPs were partially reduced upon exposure to trace concentrations of acetone vapour (at constant temperature). The latter observation suggests that acetone molecules are chemically adsorbed on iron oxide. The chemical changes are discussed in terms of the conductive response of a consubstantial chemiresistive sensor. Acetone chemisorption requires a revision of the commonly accepted sensing mechanism based on the physical adsorption of acetone molecules.","['Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.', 'Slovak Academy of Sciences', 'Institute of Physics Slovak Academy of Sciences']","['Italy', 'Slovakia']","['Pollastri S.', 'Hofbauerova M.', 'Ivanco J.']","['Acetone sensor', 'Chemi-resistors', 'Extended x-ray absorption fine structure', 'Gas sensor', 'Iron oxide', 'Nanoparticle film', 'X-ray absorption near edge structure', 'X-ray absorption spectroscopy']",Thin Solid Films,Elsevier B.V.,"['Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials', 'Surfaces, Coatings and Films', 'Metals and Alloys', 'Materials Chemistry', 'Surfaces and Interfaces']","['MATE', 'PHYS']",Article,0,53.0,2023
The role and mechanism of action of microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids in neutrophils: From the activation to becoming potential biomarkers,"© 2023 The AuthorsShort-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, have emerged as critical mediators in the communication between the human microbiota and its host. As the first responder to the inflammatory site, neutrophils play an important role in protecting the host against bacterial infections. Recent investigations revealed that SCFAs generated from microbiota influence various neutrophil activities, including activation, migration, and generation of mediators of inflammatory processes. SCFAs have also been demonstrated to exhibit potential therapeutic benefits in a variety of disorders related to neutrophil dysfunction, including inflammatory bowel disease, viral infectious disorders, and cancer. This study aims to examine the molecular processes behind the complicated link between SCFAs and neutrophils, as well as their influence on neutrophil-driven inflammatory disorders.

20(S)-ginsenoside Rh2 inhibits angiotensin-2 mediated cardiac remodeling and inflammation associated with suppression of the JNK/AP-1 pathway,"© 2023 The AuthorsBackground: Enhanced levels of angiotensin-2 (Ang-II) causes hypertensive heart failure (HHF) through non-hemodynamical and hemodynamical alterations. 20(S)-ginsenoside Rh2 (20(S)-Rh2) is a natural ginseng compound with numerous cardiovascular benefits. This investigation elucidates the influence of 20(S)-Rh2 on Ang-II-induced heart failure and cardiac alterations. Methods: Ang-II was administered in C57BL/6 mice for 4 weeks to induce HHF. In the last 2 weeks of treatment, 20(S)-Rh2 was orally administered in mice to assess the potential 20(S)-Rh2 mechanism. Subsequently, RNA sequencing was carried out. Results: It was indicated that 20(S)-Rh2 suppresses myocardial fibrosis, hypertrophy, and inflammation, thereby inhibiting cardiac disruption in Ang-II-challenged mice without affecting blood pressure. According to the RNA sequencing data, this cardio-protective effect was linked with the (JNK)/AP 1 pathway. 20(S)-Rh2 alleviated heart tissue and cardiomyocytes inflammation by inhibiting the Ang-II-mediated JNK/AP-1 pathway. Within cardiomyocytes, JNK or AP-1 absence abolished the anti-inflammatory effects of 20(S)-Rh2. Conclusion: This study investigation indicated that 20(S)-Rh2 prevents cardiovascular dysfunction induced by Ang-II induced by decreasing JNK-regulated inflammatory responses, providing evidence for its use as an efficient regimen for HHF.","['Wenzhou Medical University', ""Hangzhou First People's Hospital"", 'Beihua University', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University']",['China'],"['Xu J.', 'Han X.', 'Luo W.', 'Wang M.', 'Tu Y.', 'Wang Y.', 'Wang Q.', 'Yu T.', 'Liang G.']","['20(S)-ginsenoside Rh2', 'Angiotensin II', 'C-Jun N-terminal kinase', 'Hypertensive heart failure', 'Inflammation']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Article,0,40.0,2023
Celastrol induces premature ovarian insufficiency by inducing apoptosis in granulosa cells,"© 2023 The AuthorsCelastrol, a natural compound purified from the Chinese herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f., has excellent pharmacological activity for the treatment of various diseases. Assessing the safety of its use is essential for its development into a clinical medicine. However, research assessing its toxicity on the female reproductive system has never been reported. In this study, the ovarian toxicity of celastrol and its underlying mechanism were investigated. We found that celastrol induced premature ovarian insufficiency and apoptosis in granulosa cells. Activity-based protein profiling results showed that high mobility group box 1 was a candidate target protein of celastrol. Celastrol directly bound to Cys106 of high mobility group box 1. Knocking down high mobility group box 1 induced apoptosis of granulosa cells, while overexpression of this gene reversed celastrol-induced apoptosis. Celastrol treatment upregulated p21 transcription, but overexpression of high mobility group box 1 reversed this upregulation. Thus, Celastrol induces premature ovarian insufficiency and apoptosis in granulosa cells by directly binding to high mobility group box 1 and interfering with its biological function to regulate p21 transcription. This study provides valuable information for assessing the safety of the clinical application of celastrol on female patients.","['China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences', 'Southern Medical University', 'Shunde Hospital of Southern Medical University', ""Shenzhen People's Hospital"", 'Tsinghua School of Medicine', 'Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University']",['China'],"['Liu D.', 'Kuang W.', 'Zhang S.', 'Wang M.', 'Liu G.', 'Wang J.', 'Yuan L.', 'Wen F.']","['Activity-based protein profiling', 'Apoptosis', 'Celastrol', 'Granulosa cell', 'Premature ovarian insufficiency']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Article,0,36.0,2023
Present and future of metabolic and metabolomics studies focused on classical psychedelics in humans,"© 2023 The AuthorsPsychedelics are classical hallucinogen drugs that induce a marked altered state of consciousness. In recent years, there has been renewed attention to the possible use of classical psychedelics for the treatment of certain mental health disorders. However, further investigation to better understand their biological effects in humans, their mechanism of action, and their metabolism in humans is needed when considering the development of future novel therapeutic approaches. Both metabolic and metabolomics studies may help for these purposes. On one hand, metabolic studies aim to determine the main metabolites of the drug. On the other hand, the application of metabolomics in human psychedelics studies can help to further understand the biological processes underlying the psychedelic state and the mechanisms of action underlying their therapeutic potential. This review presents the state of the art of metabolic and metabolomic studies after lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), mescaline, N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and β-carboline alkaloids (ayahuasca brew), 5-methoxy-DMT and psilocybin administrations in humans. We first describe the characteristics of the published research. Afterward, we reviewed the main results obtained by both metabolic and metabolomics (if available) studies in classical psychedelics and we found out that metabolic and metabolomics studies in psychedelics progress at two different speeds. Thus, whereas the main metabolites for classical psychedelics have been robustly established, the main metabolic alterations induced by psychedelics need to be explored. The integration of metabolomics and pharmacokinetics for investigating the molecular interaction between psychedelics and multiple targets may open new avenues in understanding the therapeutic role of psychedelics.","['Hospital Clinic Barcelona', 'Hospital del Mar', 'Universiteit Maastricht', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer - IDIBAPS"", 'Universidad Jaume I', 'Chromatography Department']","['Netherlands', 'Spain']","['Ramaekers J.G.', 'Fabregat-Safont D.', 'Olesti E.', 'Gomez-Gomez A.', 'Madrid-Gambin F.', 'Mason N.L.', 'Pozo O.J.']","['Ayahuasca', 'Dimethyltryptamine', 'Lysergic acid diethylamide', 'Metabolism', 'Metabolomics', 'Psilocybin', 'Psychedelics']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Review,0,147.0,2023
Targeting the DNA repair pathway for breast cancer therapy: Beyond the molecular subtypes,"© 2023 The AuthorsDNA repair is a vital mechanism in cells that protects against DNA damage caused by internal and external factors. It involves a network of signaling pathways that monitor and transmit damage signals, activating various cellular activities to repair DNA damage and maintain genomic integrity. Dysfunctions in this repair pathway are strongly associated with the development and progression of cancer. However, they also present an opportunity for targeted therapy in breast cancer. Extensive research has focused on developing inhibitors that play a crucial role in the signaling pathway of DNA repair, particularly due to the remarkable success of PARP1 inhibitors (PARPis) in treating breast cancer patients with BRCA1/2 mutations. In this review, we summarize the current research progress and clinical implementation of BRCA and BRCAness in targeted treatments for the DNA repair pathway. Additionally, we present advancements in diverse inhibitors of DNA repair, both as individual and combined approaches, for treating breast cancer.

Licorice flavonoid alleviates gastric ulcers by producing changes in gut microbiota and promoting mucus cell regeneration,"© 2023Licorice flavonoid (LF) is the main component of Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, a “medicine food homology” herbal medicine, which has anti-digestive ulcer activity, but the mechanism in anti-gastric ulcer (GU) remains to be elucidated. In this study, we manifested that LF increased the viability of human gastric mucosal epithelial (GES-1) cells, attenuated ethanol (EtOH)-induced manifestations, reduced histological injury, suppressed inflammation, and restored gastric mucosal barrier in GU rats. After LF therapy, the EtOH-induced gut dysbiosis was partly modulated, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyric acid, propionic acid, and valeric acid were found in higher concentrations. We discovered that the majority of genera that increased in the GU group had a negative correlation with SCFAs in the intestinal tract. In addition, LF-upregulated SCFAs boosted mucus secretion in the gastric epithelium and the expression of mucoprotein (MUC) 5AC and MUC6, particularly the MUC5AC in the gastric foveola. Moreover, LF triggered the EGFR/ERK signal pathway which promoted gastric mucus cell regeneration. Therefore, the findings indicated that LF could inhibit inflammation, promote mucosal barrier repair and angiogenesis, regulate gut microbiota and SCFA metabolism; more importantly, promote epithelial proliferation via activation of the EGFR/ERK pathway, exerting a protective and regenerative effect on the gastric mucosa.","['Southern Medical University', 'Ltd.', 'Macau University of Science and Technology']","['China', 'Macao']","['Hu Y.', 'Zhu H.', 'Liu Q.', 'Jiang C.', 'Huang T.', 'Liang P.', 'Liu L.', 'Chen H.', 'Liang T.', 'Zhai D.', 'Zheng Z.', 'Wang Z.', 'Huang D.', 'Shen C.', 'Wu Y.', 'Guo Y.']","['Epithelial cell regeneration', 'Gastric ulcer', 'Gut microbiota', 'Licorice flavonoid', 'Short-chain fatty acids']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Article,0,55.0,
Abused drug-induced intracranial self-stimulation is correlated with the alteration of dopamine transporter availability in the medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens of mice,"© 2023 The AuthorsIntracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) of the medial forebrain bundle in mice is an experimental model use to assess the relative potential of reward-seeking behaviors. Here, we used the ICSS model to evaluate the abuse potential of 18 abused drugs: 3-Fluoroethamphetamine (3-FEA); methylphenidate; cocaine; dextroamphetamine; alpha-Pyrrolidinobutyrophenone (α-PBT); 4'-Fluoro-4-methylaminorex (4-FPO); methamphetamine; larocaine; phentermine; paramethoxymethamphetamine (PMMA); phendimetrazine; N-(1-adamantyl)-1-pentyl-1H-indazole-3-carboxamide (AKB-48); Naphthalen-1-yl-(4-pentyloxynaphthalen-1-yl)methanone (CB-13); 4-Ethylnaphthalen-1-yl-(1-pentylindol-3-yl)methanone (JWH-210); Naphthalen-1-yl-(1-pentylindol-3-yl)methanone (JWH-018); N-(ortho-methoxybenzyl)-4-ethylamphetamine (4-EA-NBOMe); N-[(2-Methoxyphenyl)methyl]-N-methyl-1-(4-methylphenyl)propan-2-amine (4-MMA-NBOMe); and 1-[1-(4-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine (4-MeO-PCP). We determined dopamine transporter (DAT) availability in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), striatum, and nucleus accumbens (NAc) after drug treatment. DAT availability in the mPFC and NAc significantly correlated with the ICSS threshold after drug treatment. Extracellular dopamine and calcium levels in PC-12 cells were measured following drug treatment. After drug treatment, Spearman rank and Pearson correlation analyses showed a significant difference between the extracellular dopamine level and the ICSS threshold. After drug treatment, Spearman rank correlation analysis showed a significant correlation between Ca2+ signaling and the ICSS threshold. A positive correlation exists between the ICSS threshold and DAT availability in the mPFC and NAc provoked by abused drugs. The relative potential of drug-induced reward-seeking behavior may be related to DAT availability-mediated extracellular dopamine levels in the mPFC and NAc.","['Osong Medical Innovation Foundation', 'Daegu Haany University', 'Chungbuk National University']",['South Korea'],"['Hong J.T.', 'Lee D.', 'Yoon S.S.', 'Gu S.M.', 'Hong E.', 'Min H.K.', 'Zhang Y.-Q.', 'Lee J.', 'Yu E.', 'Yun J.']","['Dopamine', 'Dopamine transporter', 'Intracranial self-stimulation', 'Medial prefrontal cortex', 'Nucleus accumbens']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Article,0,32.0,2023
Ferroptosis induction via targeting metabolic alterations in triple-negative breast cancer,"© 2023 The AuthorsTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive form of breast cancer, presents severe threats to women's health. Therefore, it is critical to find novel treatment approaches. Ferroptosis, a newly identified form of programmed cell death, is marked by the buildup of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) and high iron concentrations. According to previous studies, ferroptosis sensitivity can be controlled by a number of metabolic events in cells, such as amino acid metabolism, iron metabolism, and lipid metabolism. Given that TNBC tumors are rich in iron and lipids, inducing ferroptosis in these tumors is a potential approach for TNBC treatment. Notably, the metabolic adaptability of cancer cells allows them to coordinate an attack on one or more metabolic pathways to initiate ferroptosis, offering a novel perspective to improve the high drug resistance and clinical therapy of TNBC. However, a clear picture of ferroptosis in TNBC still needs to be completely revealed. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advancements regarding the connection between ferroptosis and amino acid, iron, and lipid metabolism in TNBC. We also discuss the probable significance of ferroptosis as an innovative target for chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, nanotherapy and natural product therapy in TNBC, highlighting its therapeutic potential and application prospects.",['Harbin Medical University'],['China'],"['Sun Y.', 'Wang H.', 'Wang Y.', 'Wang F.', 'Hu J.']","['Ferroptosis', 'Metabolic reprogramming', 'Therapy', 'Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Review,0,174.0,2023
The GPIHBP1-LPL complex and its role in plasma triglyceride metabolism: Insights into chylomicronemia,"© 2023 The AuthorsGPIHBP1 is a protein found in the endothelial cells of capillaries that is anchored by glycosylphosphatidylinositol and binds to high-density lipoproteins. GPIHBP1 attaches to lipoprotein lipase (LPL), subsequently carrying the enzyme and anchoring it to the capillary lumen. Enabling lipid metabolism is essential for the marginalization of lipoproteins alongside capillaries. Studies underscore the significance of GPIHBP1 in transporting, stabilizing, and aiding in the marginalization of LPL. The intricate interplay between GPIHBP1 and LPL has provided novel insights into chylomicronemia in recent years. Mutations hindering the formation or reducing the efficiency of the GPIHBP1-LPL complex are central to the onset of chylomicronemia. This review delves into the structural nuances of the GPIHBP1-LPL interaction, the consequences of mutations in the complex leading to chylomicronemia, and cutting-edge advancements in chylomicronemia treatment.","['Central South University Xiangya School of Medicine', 'Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University']",['China'],"['Jiang S.', 'Ren Z.', 'Xiao Y.', 'Yang Y.', 'Liu Q.', 'Zhou S.']","['Chylomicronemia', 'GPIHBP1', 'Lipoprotein lipase', 'Triglycerides']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Review,0,128.0,2023
Biology and function of exosomes in tumor immunotherapy,"© 2023 The AuthorsExosomes are nano-scale extracellular vesicles that are found widely in various biological fluids. As messengers, exosomes deliver characteristic biological information from donor cells, facilitating their accumulation and subsequent transfer of information to tumor immune cells. Immunotherapy is a cutting-edge strategy for cancer therapy, but it has not yet reached its full potential owing to severe side effects and limited efficacy. Exosomes possess antigens and immunostimulatory molecules and can serve as cell-free vaccines to induce antitumor immunity. In addition, given their stability, low immunogenicity, and targeting ability, exosomes represent ideal drug delivery systems in tumor immunotherapy by delivering cargoes, including non-coding ribonucleic acids (RNAs), membrane proteins, chemotherapeutic agents, and immune cell death inducers. Exosomes can also be engineered to precisely target tumor cells. However, as a rising star in tumor immunotherapy, exosomes are also impeded by some challenges, including the lack of uniform technical standards for their isolation and purification, the need to improve exosomal cargo loading for efficient exosome delivery, and the expansion of clinical trials, which are currently in their infancy. Long-term, multi-center, and large-scale clinical trials are needed to evaluate the performance of exosomes in the future. Nonetheless, exosomes have demonstrated encouraging performance in tumor immunotherapy. In this review, we summarize the potential and challenges of exosomes in tumor immunotherapy, with the aim to shed light on exosomes as new-era tumor immunotherapy tools.","['Southern Medical University', 'Dalian Medical University', 'Foshan Maternal and Child Health Hospital']",['China'],"['Xia C.', 'Liu C.']","['Drug delivery system', 'Exosomes', 'Tumor immunotherapy', 'Tumor vaccine']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Review,0,196.0,2023
rhBMP6 in autologous blood coagulum is a preferred osteoinductive device to rhBMP2 on bovine collagen sponge in the rat ectopic bone formation assay,"© 2023 The AuthorsOsteoinductive BMPs require a suitable delivery system for treating various pathological conditions of the spine and segmental bone defects. INFUSE, the only commercially available BMP-based osteoinductive device, consisting of rhBMP2 on bovine absorbable collagen sponge (ACS) showed major disadvantages due to serious side effects. A novel osteoinductive device, OSTEOGROW, comprised of rhBMP6 dispersed within autologous blood coagulum (ABC) is a promising therapy for bone regeneration, subjected to several clinical trials for diaphysial bone repair and spinal fusion. In the present study, we have examined the release dynamics showing that the ABC carrier provided a slower, more steady BMP release in comparison to the ACS. Rat subcutaneous assay was employed to evaluate cellular events and the time course of ectopic osteogenesis. The host cellular response to osteoinductive implants was evaluated by flow cytometry, while dynamics of bone formation and maintenance in time were evaluated by histology, immunohistochemistry and micro CT analyses. Flow cytometry revealed that the recruitment of lymphoid cell populations was significantly higher in rhBMP6/ABC implants, while rhBMP2/ACS implants recruited more myeloid populations. Furthermore, rhBMP6/ABC implants more efficiently attracted early and committed progenitor cells. Dynamics of bone formation induced by rhBMP2/ACS was characterized by a delayed endochondral ossification process in comparison to rhBMP6/ABC implants. Besides, rhBMP6/ABC implants induced more ectopic bone volume in all observed time points in comparison to rhBMP2/ACS implants. These results indicate that OSTEOGROW was superior to INFUSE due to ABC's advantages as a carrier and rhBMP6 superior efficacy in inducing bone.","['University of Zagreb School of Medicine', 'Scientific Center of Excellence for Reproductive and Regenerative Medicine', 'Medizinische Universität Wien', 'perForm Biologics Inc.']","['Austria', 'United States', 'Croatia']","['Vukicevic S.', 'Windhager R.', 'Sampath K.T.', 'Stokovic N.', 'Kovacic N.', 'Rumenovic V.', 'Milesevic M.', 'Grcevic D.', 'Ivanjko N.']","['Absorbable collagen sponge', 'Bioceramics', 'BMPs', 'Bone morphogenetic proteins', 'INFUSE', 'OSTEOGROW']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Article,0,66.0,2023
Vascular injury associated with ethanol intake is driven by AT1 receptor and mitochondrial dysfunction,"© 2023Background: Renin-angiotensin (Ang II)-aldosterone system (RAAS) is crucial for the cardiovascular risk associated with excessive ethanol consumption. Disturbs in mitochondria have been implicated in multiple cardiovascular diseases. However, if mitochondria dysfunction contributes to ethanol-induced vascular dysfunction is still unknown. We investigated whether ethanol leads to vascular dysfunction via RAAS activation, mitochondria dysfunction, and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). Methods: Male C57/BL6J or mt-keima mice (6–8-weeks old) were treated with ethanol (20% vol./vol.) for 12 weeks with or without Losartan (10 mg/kg/day). Results: Ethanol induced aortic hypercontractility in an endothelium-dependent manner. PGC1α (a marker of biogenesis), Mfn2, (an essential protein for mitochondria fusion), as well as Pink-1 and Parkin (markers of mitophagy), were reduced in aortas from ethanol-treated mice. Disturb in mitophagy flux was further confirmed in arteries from mt-keima mice. Additionally, ethanol increased mtROS and reduced SOD2 expression. Strikingly, losartan prevented vascular hypercontractility, mitochondrial dysfunction, mtROS, and restored SOD2 expression. Both MnTMPyP (SOD2 mimetic) and CCCP (a mitochondrial uncoupler) reverted ethanol-induced vascular dysfunction. Moreover, L-NAME (NOS inhibitor) and EUK 134 (superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetic) did not affect vascular response in ethanol group, suggesting that ethanol reduces aortic nitric oxide (NO) and H2O2 bioavailability. These responses were prevented by losartan. Conclusion: AT1 receptor modulates ethanol-induced vascular hypercontractility by promoting mitochondrial dysfunction, mtROS, and reduction of NO and H2O2 bioavailability. Our findings shed a new light in our understanding of ethanol-induced vascular toxicity and open perspectives of new therapeutic approaches for patients with disorder associated with abusive ethanol drinking.","['University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine', 'Universidade de São Paulo', 'UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh', 'Universidade Estadual Paulista ""Júlio de Mesquita Filho""', 'University of Pittsburgh']","['Brazil', 'United States']","['Tirapelli C.R.', 'Barbosa G.S.', 'Costa R.M.', 'Singh S.', 'Bruder-Nascimento A.', 'Alves J.V.', 'Bruder-Nascimento T.', 'Awata W.M.C.']","['Ethanol', 'Mitochondria', 'Reactive oxygen species', 'Vascular dysfunction']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Article,0,103.0,

Allicin extracted from Allium sativum shows potent anti-cancer and antioxidant properties in zebrafish,"© 2023 The AuthorsGarlic (Allium sativum) is an important flavouring component in Indian cuisine. Allicin, a sulphur containing compound, is the most abundant component of garlic and has been widely studied for its antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. It is also known to play a role in the regulation of blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Despite the known health benefits associated with allicin, systematic studies on its anti-cancer properties using animal models are very limited. This study aimed to develop a simple method for the extraction of allicin from fresh garlic, study the stability of the extracted compound at various temperatures, and evaluate the antioxidant, anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic and anti-angiogenic properties in zebrafish. A five-month stability study indicated that allicin remains significantly stable at temperatures 4 °C and below but shows extensive degradation if stored at room temperature. The in vivo studies in zebrafish using a combination of mutants and transgenic lines demonstrated the antioxidant, anti-proliferative, apoptotic and anti-angiogenic properties of allicin.

Advances in the roles of ATF4 in osteoporosis,"© 2023 The AuthorsOsteoporosis (OP) is characterized by reduced bone mass, decreased strength, and enhanced bone fragility fracture risk. Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) plays a role in cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, redox balance, amino acid uptake, and glycolipid metabolism. ATF4 induces the differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) into osteoblasts, increases osteoblast activity, and inhibits osteoclast formation, promoting bone formation and remodeling. In addition, ATF4 mediates the energy metabolism in osteoblasts and promotes angiogenesis. ATF4 is also involved in the mediation of adipogenesis. ATF4 can selectively accumulate in osteoblasts. ATF4 can directly interact with RUNT-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and up-regulate the expression of osteocalcin (OCN) and osterix (Osx). Several upstream factors, such as Wnt/β-catenin and BMP2/Smad signaling pathways, have been involved in ATF4-mediated osteoblast differentiation. ATF4 promotes osteoclastogenesis by mediating the receptor activator of nuclear factor κ-B (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL) signaling. Several agents, such as parathyroid (PTH), melatonin, and natural compounds, have been reported to regulate ATF4 expression and mediate bone metabolism. In this review, we comprehensively discuss the biological activities of ATF4 in maintaining bone homeostasis and inhibiting OP development. ATF4 has become a therapeutic target for OP treatment.","[""Ganzhou People's Hospital"", 'Gannan Medical College', 'Nanchang University']",['China'],"['Zhou J.', 'Xie X.', 'Kong W.', 'Xiao Y.', 'Yin G.', 'Chen Z.']","['ATF4', 'Bone remodeling', 'Osteoblast', 'Osteoclast', 'Osteogenic differentiation', 'Osteoporosis']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Review,0,238.0,2023
Regulation of anxiety-like behaviors by S-palmitoylation and S-nitrosylation in basolateral amygdala,"© 2023 The AuthorsProtein posttranslational modification regulates synaptic protein stability, sorting and trafficking, and is involved in emotional disorders. Yet the molecular mechanisms regulating emotional disorders remain unelucidated. Here we report unknown roles of protein palmitoylation/nitrosylation crosstalk in regulating anxiety-like behaviors in rats. According to the percentages of open arm duration in the elevated plus maze test, the rats were divided into high-, intermediate- and low-anxiety groups. The palmitoylation and nitrosylation levels were detected by acyl-biotin exchange assay, and we found low palmitoylation and high nitrosylation levels in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) of high-anxiety rats. Furthermore, we observed that 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP), a palmitoylation inhibitor, induced anxiety-like behaviors, accompanied with decreased amplitude and frequency of mEPSCs and mIPSCs in the BLA. Additionally, we also found that inhibiting nNOS activity with 7-nitroindazole (7-NI) in the BLA caused anxiolytic effects and reduced the synaptic transmission. Interestingly, diazepam (DZP) rapidly elevated the protein palmitoylation level and attenuated the protein nitrosylation level in the BLA. Specifically, similar to DZP, the voluntary wheel running exerted DZP-like anxiolytic action, and induced high palmitoylation and low nitrosylation levels in the BLA. Lastly, blocking the protein palmitoylation with 2-BP induced an increase in protein nitrosylation level, and attenuating the nNOS activity by 7-NI elevated the protein palmitoylation level. Collectively, these results show a critical role of protein palmitoylation/nitrosylation crosstalk in orchestrating anxiety behavior in rats, and it may serve as a potential target for anxiolytic intervention.","['Hainan Medical University', 'Zhongshan School of Medicine, SYSU', 'Fujian Medical University', 'The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University', 'Wuhan No.1 Hospital']",['China'],"['Li M.-D.', 'Liu J.-M.', 'Gao S.-Q.', 'Shen Z.-C.', 'Pan Y.', 'Xia Z.-X.', 'Zheng J.-Y.', 'Tao W.-C.', 'Tian D.']","['Anxiety', 'Basolateral amygdala', 'S-nitrosylation', 'S-palmitoylation']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Article,0,67.0,2023
Complement-pentraxins synergy: Navigating the immune battlefield and beyond,"© 2023 The AuthorsThe complement is a crucial immune defense system that triggers rapid immune responses and offers efficient protection against foreign invaders and unwanted host elements, acting as a sentinel. Activation of the complement system occurs upon the recognition of pathogenic microorganisms or altered self-cells by pattern-recognition molecules (PRMs) such as C1q, collectins, ficolins, and pentraxins. Recent accumulating evidence shows that pentraxins establish a cooperative network with different classes of effector PRMs, resulting in synergistic effects in complement activation.

Job Tenure and Unskilled Workers before the Industrial Revolution: St Paul’s Cathedral 1672–1748,"© The Author(s), 2023.How were unskilled workers selected and hired in preindustrial labor markets? We exploit records from the rebuilding of St Paul’s Cathedral, London (1672–1748), to analyze the hiring and employment histories of over 1,000 general building laborers, the benchmark category of “unskilled” workers in long-run wage series. Despite volatile demand, St Paul’s created a stable workforce by rewarding the tenure of long-standing workers. More senior workers received more days of work each month, preference when jobs were scarce, and the opportunity to earn additional income.

Phytosterols activating nuclear receptors are involving in steroid hormone-dependent cancers: Myth or fact?,"© 2023 The AuthorsNuclear receptors (NRs) represent intracellular proteins that function as a signaling network of transcriptional factors to control genes in response to a variety of environmental, dietary, and hormonal stimulations or serve as orphan receptors lacking a recognized ligand. They also play an essential role in normal development, metabolism, cell growth, cell division, physiology, reproduction, and homeostasis and function as biological markers for tumor subclassification and as targets for hormone therapy. NRs, including steroid hormone receptors (SHRs), have been studied as tools to examine the fundamentals of transcriptional regulation within the development of mammals and human physiology, in addition to their links to disturbances. In this regard, it is widely recognized that aberrant NR signaling is responsible for the pathological growth of hormone-dependent tumors in response to SHRs dysregulation and consequently represents a potential therapeutic candidate in a range of diseases, as in the case of prostate cancer and breast cancer. On the other hand, phytosterols are a group of plant-derived compounds that act directly as ligands for NRs and have proven their efficacy in the management of diabetes, heart diseases, and cancers. However, these plants are not suggested in cases of hormone-dependent cancer since a certain group of plants contains molecules with a chemical structure similar to that of estrogens, which are known as phytoestrogens or estrogen-like compounds, such as lignans, coumestans, and isoflavones. Therefore, it remains an open and controversial debate regarding whether consuming a phytosterol-rich diet and adopting a vegetarian lifestyle like the Mediterranean diet may increase the risk of developing steroid hormone-dependent cancers by constitutively activating SHRs and thereby leading to tumor transformation. Overall, the purpose of this review is to better understand the relevant mechanistic pathways and explore epidemiological investigations in order to establish that phytosterols may contribute to the activation of NRs as cancer drivers in hormone-dependent cancers.","['Jazan University', 'National Center for Research Sudan', 'Faculté de Médecine et de Pharmacie de Rabat', 'INTI International University', 'Université Ibn Zohr', 'Sunway University', 'Umm Al-Qura University', 'Frontier Medical &amp;amp', 'Faculté des Sciences Rabat']","['Morocco', 'Sudan', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Malaysia', 'Pakistan']","['El Omari N.', 'Bakrim S.', 'Goh K.W.', 'Aboulaghras S.', 'Chook J.B.', 'Bouyahya A.', 'Khan E.J.', 'Abdalla A.N.', 'Ming L.C.', 'Khalid A.']","['Breast cancer', 'Hormone-dependent cancers', 'Nuclear receptors', 'Phytosterols', 'Prostate cancer', 'Steroid hormone receptors', 'Vegetarian diets']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Review,0,126.0,2023
TrxR/Trx inhibitor butaselen ameliorates pulmonary fibrosis by suppressing NF-κB/TGF-β1/Smads signaling,"© 2023 The AuthorsPulmonary fibrosis is highly lethal with limited treatments. Butaselen (BS) is an inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR)/thioredoxin (Trx) with anti-tumor activity. However, its impact on pulmonary fibrosis and the involved mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that BS is a potential drug for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis. Specifically, BS can inhibit pulmonary fibrosis both in vitro and in vivo, with comparable efficacy and enhanced safety when compared with pirfenidone. BS and dexamethasone display a synergistic effect in inhibiting pulmonary fibrosis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic studies reveal that BS can inhibit the TrxR activity during pulmonary fibrosis. RNA-sequencing analysis identifies that genes of ECM-related signaling pathways are notably affected by BS. BS can not only inhibit the activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and reduce pulmonary fibrosis-related inflammation, but also reduce NF-κB-activated transcriptional expression of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), which leads to the inactivation of Smad2/Smad3 and decrease of collagen formation and fibrosis. Moreover, the knockdown of Trx1 with siRNA can also inhibit NF-κB/TGF-β1/Smads signaling. In conclusion, the TrxR/Trx inhibitor butaselen can suppress pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting NF-κB/TGF-β1/Smads signaling.","['Peking University Health Science Center', 'Peking University Third Hospital', 'Shanghai Yuanxi Medicine Corp']",['China'],"['Zeng H.', 'Zhang Y.', 'Zhang G.', 'Yin H.', 'Chen Y.', 'Sun J.']","['Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB)', 'Pulmonary fibrosis', 'Thioredoxin', 'Thioredoxin reductase', 'Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Article,0,62.0,2023
Self-driven bioactive hybrids co-deliver doxorubicin and indocyanine green nanoparticles for chemo/photothermal therapy of breast cancer,"© 2023 The AuthorsBreast cancer is characterized by insidious onset, rapid progression, easy recurrence, and metastasis. Conventional monotherapies are usually ineffective due to insufficient drug delivery. Therefore, the combination of multimodal therapy with tumor microenvironment (TME)-responsive nanoplatforms is increasingly being considered for the targeted treatment of breast cancer. We synthesized bioactive hybrid nanoparticles for synergistic chemotherapy and photothermal therapy. Briefly, doxorubicin (DOX) and indocyanine green (ICG)-loaded nanoparticles (DI) of average particle size 113.58 ± 2.14 nm were synthesized, and their surface were modified with polydopamine (PDA) and attached to the anaerobic probiotic Bifidobacterium infantis (Bif). The bioactive Bif@DIP hybrid showed good photothermal conversion efficiency of about 38.04%. In addition, the self-driving ability of Bif allowed targeted delivery of the PDA-coated DI nanoparticles (DIP) to the hypoxic regions of the tumor. The low pH and high GSH levels in the TME stimulated the controlled release of DOX and ICG from the Bif@DIP hybrid, which then triggered apoptosis of tumor cells and induced immunogenic cell death (ICD), resulting in effective and sustained anti-tumor effect with minimum systemic toxicity. Thus, the self-driven Bif@DIP hybrid is a promising nanodrug for the targeted chemotherapy and photothermal therapy against solid cancers.","['Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province', 'Luzhou Medical College', 'The Affiliated Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital of Southwest Medical University', 'Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University']",['China'],"['Wu Z.', 'Lu Y.', 'Zeng F.', 'Fu S.', 'Wen Q.', 'Dai J.', 'Chen L.', 'Chen Y.', 'Zhou P.', 'Fan Y.', 'Li J.']","['Bifidobacterium', 'Breast cancer', 'Chemo/photothermal combined therapy', 'Doxorubicin', 'Indocyanine green', 'Targeted therapy']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Article,0,58.0,2023
Effects of dapagliflozin monotherapy and combined aerobic exercise on skeletal muscle mitochondrial quality control and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus rats,"© 2023 The AuthorsType 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a prevalent, chronic metabolic disease. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and aerobic exercise (AE) have shown promise in mitigating insulin resistance (IR) and T2DM. This study investigated the effects of dapagliflozin (Dapa) monotherapy and combined AE on mitochondrial quality control (MQC) in skeletal muscle and IR in T2DM rats. T2DM rats, induced by a high-fat diet/streptozotocin model, were randomly assigned to the following groups: T2DM+vehicle group (DMV), T2DM rats treated with Dapa (DMDa, 10 mg/kg/d), T2DM rats subjected to combined Dapa treatment and AE (DMDa+AE), and the standard control group (CON). Blood and skeletal muscle samples were collected after 6 weeks of intragastric administration and treadmill exercise. The results showed that DMDa monotherapy could reduce the accumulation of white adipose tissue and skeletal muscle lipid droplets and improve HOMA-IR. While the combined AE led to further reductions in subcutaneous white adipose tissue and fasting glucose levels, it did not confer additional benefits in terms of HOMA-IR. Furthermore, Dapa monotherapy enhanced skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1α, NRF1, TFAM, and COX IV), mitochondrial dynamics (OPA1, DRP1, and MFN2), and mitophagy (PGAM5 and PINK1) related protein levels. Nevertheless, the combination of Dapa with AE treatment did not yield an additive effect. In conclusion, this study highlights the potential of SGLT2 inhibitors, specifically Dapa, in ameliorating IR and maintaining MQC in skeletal muscle in rats with T2DM. However, combined AE did not produce an additive effect, indicating the need for further research.","[""Jinhua People's Hospital"", 'Zhejiang Normal University', 'Jinhua Polytechnic', 'Northeast Normal University']",['China'],"['Zhang L.', 'Yang X.', 'Sheng X.', 'Quan H.', 'Zhai X.', 'Li W.', 'Wang L.', 'Lin H.', 'Li T.', 'Shi J.']","['Aerobic exercise', 'Dapagliflozin', 'Insulin resistance', 'Mitochondrial quality control', 'Skeletal muscle', 'Type 2 diabetes mellitus']",Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,Elsevier Masson s.r.l.,['Pharmacology'],['PHAR'],Article,0,66.0,2023
Mitochondrial glutamate transporter SLC25A22 uni-directionally export glutamate for metabolic rewiring in radioresistant glioblastoma,"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is a malignant primary brain tumor. Radiotherapy, one of the standard treatments for GBM patients, could induce GBM radioresistance via rewiring cellular metabolism. However, the precise mechanism attributing to GBM radioresistance or targeting strategies to overcome GBM radioresistance are lacking. Here, we demonstrate that SLC25A22, a mitochondrial bi-directional glutamate transporter, is upregulated and showed uni-directionality from mitochondria to cytosol in radioresistant GBM cells, resulting in accumulating cytosolic glutamate. However, mitochondrial glutaminolysis-mediated TCA cycle metabolites and OCR are maintained constantly. The accumulated cytosolic glutamate enhances the glutathione (GSH) production and proline synthesis in radioresistant GBM cells. Increased GSH protects cells against ionizing radiation (IR)-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) whereas increased proline, a rate-limiting substrate for collagen biosynthesis, induces extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, leading to GBM invasive phenotypes. Finally, we discover that genetic inhibition of SLC25A22 using miR-184 mimic decreases GBM radioresistance and aggressiveness both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our study suggests that SLC25A22 upregulation confers GBM radioresistance by rewiring glutamate metabolism, and SLC25A22 could be a significant therapeutic target to overcome GBM radioresistance.","['Pusan National University', 'Sejong University', 'Pusan National University Hospital', 'Inje University Paik Hospital', 'e-biogen Inc.', 'Emory University School of Medicine']","['South Korea', 'United States']","['Kim B.', 'Shin E.', 'Lee J.-M.', 'Youn B.', 'Lee H.', 'Lee J.S.', 'Kim H.Y.', 'Jo S.', 'Youn H.', 'Park E.', 'Park J.', 'Kang J.', 'Kang H.']","['Glioblastoma', 'Radioresistance', 'SLC25A22']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,62.0,2023
Structural and functional alterations of polydopamine-coated hemoglobin: New insights for the development of successful oxygen carriers,"© 2023One of the major factors that is currently hindering the development of hemoglobin (Hb)-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) is the autoxidation of Hb into nonfunctional methemoglobin. Modification with polydopamine (PDA), which is a biocompatible free radical scavenger has shown the ability to protect Hb against oxidation. Due to its tremendous potential in the development of successful HBOCs, herein, we conduct a thorough evaluation of the effect of PDA on the stability, aggregation, structure and function of the underlying Hb. By UV–vis spectrometry we show that PDA can prevent Hb's aggregation while thermal denaturation studies indicate that, although PDA coating resulted in a lower midpoint transition temperature, it was also able to protect the protein from full denaturation. These results are further corroborated by differential scanning calorimetry. Circular dichroism reveals that PDA can promote changes in Hb's secondary structure while, by UV–vis spectroscopy, we show that PDA also interacts with the porphyrin complex located in Hb's hydrophobic pocket. Last but not least, affinity studies show that PDA-coated Hb has a higher capability for oxygen release. Such an effect is further enhanced at lower pH. Importantly, through molecular docking simulations we provide a plausible explanation for the observed experimental results.","['University of Tehran', 'Technical University of Denmark']","['Denmark', 'Iran']","['Ghourchian H.', 'Nadimifar M.', 'Moosavi-Movahedi A.A.', 'Hosta-Rigau L.']","['Antioxidant activity', 'Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers', 'Polydopamine']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,48.0,1979
Development of curcumin-loaded galactosylated chitosan-coated nanoparticles for targeted delivery of hepatocellular carcinoma,"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.Curcumin (CUR) has good antitumor effects, but its poor aqueous solubility severely limits its clinical application and the systemic nonspecific distribution of the free drug in tumor patients is a key therapeutic challenge. In order to overcome the limitations of free drugs and improve the therapeutic efficacy, we developed novel galactosylated chitosan (GC)-modified nanoparticles (GC@NPs) based on poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether-block-poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PEG-PLGA), which can target asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocellular carcinoma cells and have excellent biocompatibility. The results showed that the drug loading (DL) of CUR was approximately 4.56 %. A favorable biosafety profile was maintained up to concentrations of 500 μg/mL. Furthermore, in vitro cellular assays showed that GC@NPs could be efficiently internalized by HepG2 cells via ASGPR-mediated endocytosis and successfully released CUR for chemotherapy. More importantly, in vivo anti-tumor experiments revealed that GC@NPs were able to accumulate effectively within tumor sites through EPR effect and ASGPR-mediated endocytosis, leading to superior inhibition of tumor growth compared to free CUR. Overall, GC@NPs are a promising CUR nanocarrier for enhanced tumor therapy with a good biosafety profile.","['Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine', 'China Pharmaceutical University']",['China'],"['Huang M.', 'Liu J.', 'Fan Y.', 'Zhang X.-F.', 'Zhai B.-T.', 'Guo D.-Y.', 'Sun J.', 'Cheng J.-X.']","['ASGPR', 'Curcumin', 'Galactosylated chitosan', 'Liver cancer', 'Nanoparticles', 'PEG-PLGA']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,62.0,2023
CRISPR-dCpf1 mediated whole genome crRNA inhibition library for high-throughput screening of growth characteristic genes in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LB1ba02,"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LB1ba02 is generally recognized as food safe (GRAS) microbial host and important enzyme-producing strain in the industry. However, autolysis affects the growth of bacteria, further affecting the yield of target products. Besides, the restriction-modification system, existed in B. amyloliquefaciens LB1ba02, results in a low transformation efficiency, which further leads to a lack of high-throughput screening tools. Here, we constructed a genome-wide crRNA inhibition library based on the CRISPR/dCpf1 system and high-throughput screening of related genes affecting the cell growth and autolysis using flow cytometry in B. amyloliquefaciens LB1ba02. The whole genome crRNA library was first validated for resistance to the toxic chemical 5-fluorouracil, and then used for validation of essential genes. In addition, seven gene loci (oppD, flil, tuaA, prmA, sigO, hslU, and GE03231) that affect the growth characteristics of LB1ba02 were screened. Among them, the Opp system had the greatest impact on growth. When the expression of operon oppA-oppB-oppC-oppD-oppF was inhibited, the cell growth difference was most significant. Inhibition of other sites could also promote rapid growth of bacteria to varying degrees; however, inhibition of GE03231 site accelerated cell autolysis. Therefore, the whole genome crRNA inhibition library is well suited for B. amyloliquefaciens LB1ba02 and can be further applied to high-throughput mining of other functional genes.",['South China University of Technology'],['China'],"['Jia H.', 'Wang B.', 'Pan L.', 'Xin Q.']","['Bacillus amyloliquefaciens', 'CRISPR/dCpf1', 'Growth characteristics', 'High-throughput screening']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,28.0,2023
High performance chitosan/nanocellulose-based composite membrane for alkaline direct ethanol fuel cells,"© 2023 The AuthorsPolysaccharide anion exchange membranes (AEMs) containing chitosan (CS), cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) and CNFs quaternized with poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (CNF(P)s) were developed for use in alkaline direct ethanol fuel cells (ADEFCs). The resulting composite membranes prepared by the solvent casting process based on an experimental design were comprehensively assessed for morphology, KOH uptake, swelling ratio, EtOH permeability, mechanical properties, ionic conductivity, and cell performance. The fabricated CS-based composite membranes with CNF(P) fillers were superior to the commercial Fumatech FAA-3-50 membrane in terms of Young's modulus and tensile strength (69 % and 85 % higher, respectively), ion exchange capacity (169 % higher), and ionic conductivity (228 % higher). Single fuel cell tests have shown excellent performance of the CS-based membranes with CNF and CNF(P) fillers, as they exhibited up to 86 % improvement in power density at 80 °C compared to the commercial membrane (65.1 mW/cm2 vs. 35.1 mW/cm2) and higher maximum power density at all test conditions.","['Univerza v Ljubljani', 'Univerza v Mariboru', 'Institut für Chemische Verfahrenstechnik und Umwelttechnik']","['Austria', 'Slovenia']","['Gorgieva S.', 'Hacker V.', 'Hren M.', 'Genorio B.', 'Roschger M.', 'Fakin D.']","['Alkaline direct ethanol fuel cell', 'Anion exchange membrane', 'Cellulose nanofibrils', 'Chitosan', 'Poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride)']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,31.0,2023
Improved accuracy in pentraxin-3 quantification assisted by aqueous biphasic systems as serum pretreatment strategies,"© 2023 The AuthorsAlthough pentraxin-3 holds promise as a diagnosis/prognosis biomarker of microbial infections and lung cancer, its analysis in human serum can be constrained by matrix effects caused by high abundance proteins – human serum albumin and immunoglobulin G. Aqueous biphasic systems composed of polymers and citrate buffer are here proposed as a serum pretreatment step to improve the accuracy of pentraxin-3 analysis. Binodal curves were determined to identify the compositions required to form two phases and to correlate the polymers' properties and performance in serum pretreatment and biomarker extraction. Aqueous biphasic systems were evaluated regarding their ability to deplete human serum albumin and immunoglobulin G at the interphase. Polymers of relatively high to intermediate hydrophobicity were unveiled as efficient components to deplete high abundance serum proteins. Considering the possibility to extract pentraxin-3 from human serum into the polymer-rich phase, the system composed of polyethylene glycol with a molecular weight of 1000 g·mol−1 simultaneously achieved >93 % of human serum albumin and immunoglobulin G depletion and complete biomarker extraction. The accuracy of analysis of pretreated human serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays outperformed that of a non-pretreated sample, with a relative error of 0.8 % compared to 14.6 %, contributing to boost pentraxin-3 usefulness as a biomarker.",['CICECO – Instituto de Materiais de Aveiro'],['Portugal'],"['Mendes M.S.M.', 'Coutinho J.A.P.', 'e Silva F.A.', 'Rosa M.E.', 'Freire M.G.']","['Aqueous biphasic system', 'Human serum', 'Pentraxin-3', 'Sample pretreatment', 'Three-phase partitioning systems']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,76.0,2023

Paper as smart support for bioreceptor immobilization in electrochemical paper-based devices,"© 2023 The AuthorsThe use of paper as a smart support in the field of electrochemical sensors has been largely improved over the last 15 years, driven by its outstanding features such as foldability and porosity, which enable the design of reagent and equipment-free multi-analysis devices. Furthermore, the easy surface engineering of paper has been used to immobilize different bioreceptors, through physical adsorption, covalent bonding, and electrochemical polymerization, boosting the fine customization of the analytical performances of paper-based biosensors. In this review, we focused on the strategies to engineer the surface of the paper for the immobilization of (bio)recognition elements (eg., enzymes, antibodies, DNA, molecularly imprinted polymers) with the overriding goal to develop accurate and reliable paper-based electrochemical biosensors. Furthermore, we highlighted how to take advantage of paper for designing smart configurations by integrating different analytical processes in an eco-designed analytical tool, starting from the immobilization of the (bio)receptor and the reagents, through a designed sample flow along the device, until the analyte detection.","['SENSE4MED', 'Università degli Studi di Roma ""Tor Vergata""']",['Italy'],"['Gullo L.', 'Seddaoui N.', 'Arduini F.', 'Colozza N.']","['Antibodies', 'Aptamers', 'Enzymes', 'Molecularly imprinted polymers', 'Nucleic acids']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,97.0,2023
Development of a model for granule-bound starch synthase I activity using free-energy calculations,"© 2023Starch is a branched polymer of glucose with two components, both of which have (1 → 4)-α linear links and (1 → 6)-α branch points: amylopectin, of high molecular weight with many short branches, and amylose, of lower molecular weight and only a few long-chain branches. Granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) is one of the main enzymes controlling amylose synthesis and chain-length distribution. As production of different GBSSI mutants is time-consuming and laborious, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used here to predict the binding of different GBSSI mutants to a representative amylose fragment. The simulations were atomistic, with explicit solvent and docking, a method successfully used to understand the binding of wild-type GBSSI to amylose fragments. The binding of GBSSI to G5 (a pentasaccharide amylose fragment) is combined with free-energy calculations employing a thermodynamic integration method to predict the effects of mutations on enzyme activity. Ten GBSSI mutants with different enzyme activities were analyzed to find the structural and energy changes among different single amino-acid mutants and their possible relationship to starch characteristics. Comparing the structural changes and the relative binding free energy of G5 to the wild type GBSSI and GBSSI mutants, it was found that mutants with negative binding energy (lower than −2.0 kcal/mol) are more likely to have higher enzyme activity and amylose content compared to the wild type. This theoretical paper used simulations and robust free energy calculations to interpret in planta data with potential predictions as to what mutants might be generated to give desired properties. This study can be used to help develop grains with improved functional properties.","['Yangzhou University', 'The University of Queensland', 'Griffith University']","['China', 'Australia']","['Gilbert R.G.', 'Fan X.', 'Zhang S.', 'Malde A.K.']","['Binding free energy', 'Granule-bound starch synthase I', 'Molecular dynamics simulations']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,37.0,1979
"Identification and evaluation of CAZyme genes, along with functional characterization of a new GH46 chitosanase from Streptomyces sp. KCCM12257","© 2023 The AuthorsThe genomic analysis of Streptomyces sp. KCCM12257 presented 233 CAZyme genes with a predominant glycosyl hydrolase family. This contributes degradation of various polysaccharides including chitin and chitosan, and other promising candidates for the production of different oligosaccharides. We screened the strain providing different polysaccharides as a sole source of carbon and strain KCCM12257, showed higher activity towards colloidal chitosan. Further, we identified and characterized a new chitosanase (MDI5907146) of GH46 family. There was no activity towards chitin, carboxymethylcellulose, or even with chitosan powder. This enzyme acts on colloidal chitosan and hydrolyzes it down into monoacetyl chitobiose, which consists of two glucosamine units with an acetyl group attached to them. The maximum enzyme activity was observed at pH 6.5 and 40 °C using colloidal chitosan as a substrate. The Co2+ metal ions almost double the reaction as compared to other metal ions. The dissociation constant (Km) and of colloidal chitosan (≥90 % and ≥75%DD) were 3.03 mg/ml and 5.01 mg/ml respectively, while maximum velocity (Vmax) values were found to be 36 mg/ml, and 30 μM/μg/min, respectively. Similarly, catalytic efficiency (Kcat/Km) of colloidal chitosan with ≥90 %DD was 1.9 fold higher than colloidal chitosan with ≥75%DD.","['Korea Polar Research Institute', 'Genome-based BioIT Convergence Institute', 'Sunmoon University']",['South Korea'],"['Pardhe B.D.', 'Paudel L.', 'Oh T.-J.', 'Han S.-R.', 'Lee J.H.']","['CAZyme', 'Chitosanase', 'Whole genome']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,55.0,2023
Evolution of the ability to evade host innate immune defense by Talaromyces marneffei,"© 2023Talaromyces (Penicillium) marneffei is an intracellular pathogenic fungus. Some strains of this fungus have been misidentified due to the similarity between Talaromyces and Penicillium. T. marneffei has mainly been found to afflict immunocompromised individuals, causing respiratory, skin, and systemic mycosis. Mp1p is a key virulence factor that can help T. marneffei evade clearance by the normally functioning immune system. Understanding how novel functions arise is an intriguing question in many fields of biology. Mp1p has two homologous domains (Mp1p-LBD1 and Mp1p-LBD2). Sequence similarity searches with Mp1p-LBD sequences revealed Mp1p homologs in many other pathogenic fungi. Integrated information on the taxonomic distribution, phylogenetic relationships, and sequence similarity of Mp1p domains revealed that the ancestor of Mp1p-LBDs was acquired through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Additional evidence revealed that Mp1p homologs have undergone extensive gene duplications in T. marneffei. Mp1p might be a result of gene fusion following gene duplication. Furthermore, we propose a new method for identifying Talaromyces and identify 4 strains with misclassification errors. Our results characterize the evolutionary mechanism of T. marneffei evasion of host innate immune defense and clearly demonstrate the role of gene duplication and HGT in the evolution of host immune escape by T. marneffei.",['Beijing Institute of Biotechnology'],['China'],"['Kang F.', 'Yue J.', 'Zhang F.', 'Chai Z.', 'Jin Y.', 'Ren H.', 'Zhang Z.', 'Yang Z.', 'Li B.']","['Evolution', 'Mp1p', 'Talaromyces marneffei']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,60.0,1979
How inhaled corticosteroids target inflammation in COPD,"© The authors 2023.Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the most commonly used anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of COPD. COPD has been previously described as a “corticosteroid-resistant” condition, but current clinical trial evidence shows that selected COPD patients, namely those with increased exacerbation risk plus higher blood eosinophil count (BEC), can benefit from ICS treatment. This review describes the components of inflammation modulated by ICS in COPD and the reasons for the variation in response to ICS between individuals. There are corticosteroid-insensitive inflammatory pathways in COPD, such as bacteria-induced macrophage interleukin-8 production and resultant neutrophil recruitment, but also corticosteroid-sensitive pathways including the reduction of type 2 markers and mast cell numbers. The review also describes the mechanisms whereby ICS can skew the lung microbiome, with reduced diversity and increased relative abundance, towards an excess of proteobacteria. BEC is a biomarker used to enable the selective use of ICS in COPD, but the clinical outcome in an individual is decided by a complex interacting network involving the microbiome and airway inflammation.","['Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust', 'Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health']",['United Kingdom'],"['Lea S.', 'Beech A.', 'Singh D.', 'Higham A.']",,European Respiratory Review,European Respiratory Society,['Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine'],['MEDI'],Review,0,155.0,2023
Ergonomics of bronchoscopy: good advice or a pain in the neck?,"© The authors 2023.Interventional pulmonologists require a unique set of skills including precise motor abilities and physical endurance, but surprisingly the application of ergonomic principles in the field of bronchoscopy remains limited. This is particularly intriguing when considering the significant impact that poor ergonomics can have on diagnostic aptitude, income potential and overall health. It is therefore imperative to provide comprehensive education to physicians regarding the significance of ergonomics in their work, especially considering the introduction of advanced diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. By implementing simple yet effective measures (e.g. maintaining neutral positions of the wrist, neck and shoulder; adjusting the height of tables and monitors; incorporating scheduled breaks; and engaging in regular exercises), the risk of injuries can be substantially reduced. Moreover, objective tools are readily available to assess ergonomic postures and estimate the likelihood of work-related musculoskeletal injuries.

Montelukast in paediatric asthma and allergic rhinitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"© The authors 2023.Background: We aim to assess the impact of montelukast on paediatric patients with asthma/allergic rhinitis, measured using patient-reported outcome measures, compared with other treatments or placebo. Methods: Protocol registration CRD42020216098 (www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO). MEDLINE and Embase databases were used to conduct the search. Two authors independently selected studies and extracted data, and a third reviewer resolved discrepancies. Meta-analyses were constructed to estimate the standardised mean difference (SMD) using a random-effects model. Results: Out of 3937 articles identified, 49 studies met the inclusion criteria, mostly randomised clinical trials (sample sizes: 21–689 patients). The SMD of change pooled estimators for the global, mental and physical domains of health-related quality of life were not statistically significant. For daytime and night-time symptoms scores, the SMD (95% CI) was in favour of inhaled corticosteroids (−0.12, −0.20– −0.05 and −0.23, −0.41– −0.06, respectively). The pooled estimator for global asthma symptoms was better for montelukast when compared with placebo (0.90, 0.44–1.36). Conclusions: The synthesis of the available evidence suggests that, in children and adolescents, montelukast was effective in controlling asthma symptoms when compared with placebo, but inhaled corticosteroids were superior in controlling symptoms, especially at night-time. These findings of our systematic review concur with current guidelines for asthma treatment.","['Hospital del Mar', 'Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona', 'Universitat Pompeu Fabra Barcelona', 'Centro de Salud Los Castros', 'Institut de Recerca Sant Pau (IR SANT PAU)', 'Universidad de Costa Rica', 'Centro de Salud La Candelaria', 'Parc Taulí Hospital Universitari', 'Hospital Universitario Jerez de la Frontera', 'Grupo de Vías Respiratorias de la Asociación Española de Pediatras de Atención Primaria (AEPAP)', 'Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Epidemiología y Salud Pública']","['Costa Rica', 'Spain']","['Miret C.', 'Zamora V.', 'Pardo Y.', 'Mayoral K.', 'Praena-Crespo M.', 'Garin O.', 'Barrufet C.', 'Bercedo A.', 'Guerra M.T.', 'Zapata M.J.M.', 'Valdesoiro-Navarrete L.', 'Lizano-Barrantes C.', 'Caballero-Rabasco M.A.', 'Pont A.', 'Ferrer M.']",,European Respiratory Review,European Respiratory Society,['Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine'],['MEDI'],Review,0,94.0,2023
Decreasing predictable DNA off-target effects and narrowing editing windows of adenine base editors by fusing human Rad18 protein variant,"© 2023 The AuthorsAdenine base editors, enabling targeted A-to-G conversion in genomic DNA, have enormous potential in therapeutic applications. However, the currently used adenine base editors are limited by wide editing windows and off-target effects in genetic therapy. Here, we report human e18 protein, a RING type E3 ubiquitin ligase variant, fusing with adenine base editors can significantly improve the preciseness and narrow the editing windows compared with ABEmax and ABE8e by diminishing the abundance of base editor protein. As a proof of concept, ABEmax-e18 and ABE8e-e18 dramatically decrease Cas9-dependent and Cas9-independent off-target effects than traditional adenine base editors. Moreover, we utilized ABEmax-e18 to establish syndactyly mouse models and achieve accurate base conversion at human PCSK9 locus in HepG2 cells which exhibited its potential in genetic therapy. Furthermore, a truncated version of base editors-RING (ABEmax-RING or AncBE4max-RING), which fusing the 63 amino acids of e18 protein RING domain to the C terminal of ABEmax or AncBE4max, exhibited similar effect compared to ABEmax-e18 or AncBE4max-e18.In summary, the e18 or RING protein fused with base editors strengthens the precise toolbox in gene modification and maybe works well with various base editing tools with a more applicable to precise genetic therapies in the future.","['Chongqing Jitang Biotechnology Research Institute', 'Jilin University']",['China'],"['Ma L.', 'Li Z.', 'Ouyang H.', 'Deng J.', 'Xiao W.', 'Qiu J.', 'Pang D.', 'Li X.', 'Yuan H.', 'Zhang Y.', 'Wang Z.', 'Yang L.']","['Base editors', 'Editing windows', 'Off-target', 'RING type E3 ubiquitin ligase']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,46.0,2023
Biochemical characterisation of cellulose and cell-wall-matrix polysaccharides in variously oxidised sugar-beet pulp preparations differing in viscosity,"© 2023 The AuthorsSugar-beet pulp (SBP) is an abundant, cellulose-rich, non-food by-product of agriculture. Oxidised SBP (oP) has valuable viscosity attributes, and different oxidation protocols yield higher- or lower-viscosity oP. We investigated how SBP polysaccharides change during oxidation, since these changes must define oP quality. Oxidation solubilised much pectin and hemicellulose; however, most cellulose stayed insoluble. Fresh SBP contains negligible ‘hemicellulose a’ (=alkali-extractable polysaccharides that precipitate upon acidification), but oxidation created abundant glucose-rich ‘hemicellulose a’ from SBP cellulose. We propose that the cellulose acquired –COOH groups, conferring alkali-extractability and admitting more water, thereby augmenting viscosity. The pectin and hemicellulose molecules that were retained during oxidation had been partially depolymerised, and their median Mr correlated negatively with oP viscosity. We developed a novel procedure to explore cellulose's permeability by measuring the ingress of tritium from [3H]water into microfibrils and its retention during desiccation. In high-crystallinity Avicel, 75 % of the cellulose's –OH groups were inaccessible to [3H]water, whereas filter-paper cellulose acquired the theoretical maximum 3H, indicating an open structure. Retention of 3H by oP preparations correlated positively with viscosity, indicating that increased cellulose accessibility generates a viscous oP. In conclusion, depolymerisation and solubilisation of matrix polysaccharides, accompanied by increasing water-accessibility of cellulose, enhanced SBP's viscosity.","['CelluComp Ltd.', 'The University of Edinburgh']",['United Kingdom'],"['Whale E.', 'Fry S.C.', 'Bulling A.E.K.']","['Cellulose accessibility', 'Cellulose modification', 'Polysaccharide oxidation', 'Sugar-beet pulp', 'Viscosity']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,47.0,2023
"From micro to macro: Physical-chemical characterization of wheat starch-based films modified with PEG200, sodium citrate, or citric acid","© 2023 The AuthorsNeeding to extend the shelf-life of packaged food and the evolving consumer demands led researchers to seek innovative, eco-friendly, and biocompatible packaging solutions. Starch is among the most promising natural and renewable alternatives to non-degradable plastics. Here, we deeply study the structural features of starch films modified by adding citric acid (CA) or sodium citrate (SC) as a cross-linker and polyethylene glycol 200 (PEG200) as a plasticizer and obtained through solvent casting. The substances' influence on starch films was evaluated through Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) and Solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (ss-NMR) spectroscopies. Films' macroscopic properties, such as swelling index, solubility, thermo-mechanical features, and moisture absorption, were also assessed to foresee potential applications. Proper amounts of CA, CS, and PEG200 improve film properties and inhibit starch chains' retrogradation and recrystallization. Besides, the chemical neighbourhood of nuclei observed through ss-NMR significantly changed alongside the polymer chains' mobility. The latter result indicates a different polymer chain structural organization that could justify the film's higher resistance to thermal degradation and elongation at the break. This methodological approach is effective in predicting the macroscopic behaviour of a polymeric material and could be helpful for the application of such products in food preservation.",['Università degli Studi di Palermo'],['Italy'],"['Calvino M.M.', 'Chillura Martino D.F.', 'Meo P.L.', 'Conte P.', 'Lazzara G.', 'Piacenza E.', 'Librici C.', 'Ciaramitaro V.']","['Mechanical resistance', 'Polysaccharide films', 'Relaxometry', 'Retrogradation', 'Starch', 'Thermal analysis']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,1,73.0,2023
Properties and flame retardancy of polylactide composites incorporating tricresyl phosphate and modified microcrystalline cellulose from oil palm empty fruit bunch waste,"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.One of the major environmental issues that have an impact on humans, animals, and their surroundings is plastic garbage. The use of biodegradable polymers in place of traditional plastics is one of the best solutions to this significant issue. The bio-circular-green (BCG) economic model is supported by the use of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) as a bio-filler for polylactide (PLA) composites, which may also help to address the issue of improper plastic waste management. This study explores the chemical modification of MCC derived from oil palm empty fruit bunch waste (OPMC). Maleic anhydride-modified OPMC (MAMC) is successfully synthesized by a solvent-free and low temperature heating procedure. MAMC and tricresyl phosphate (TCP) were used as additives in PLA composites which were processed by melt extrusion and compression molding. Characterization studies confirmed the successful modification of MAMC and indicated that TCP played a crucial role as an effective plasticizer and flame retardant for PLA. All PLA/TCP composites showed significantly improved toughness and delayed ignition. The appropriate TCP level was 10 phr. The incorporation of TCP and MAMC resulted in a synergistic enhancement of impact strength and maintained excellent flame inhibition. Moreover, the thermal stability of the PLA composites increased with increments of MAMC.",['Prince of Songkla University'],['Thailand'],"['Suparanon T.', 'Phetwarotai W.', 'Phusunti N.']","['Flame retardant', 'Modification', 'Polylactide']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,52.0,2023
Crystal structure of mRNA cap (guanine-N7) methyltransferase E12 subunit from monkeypox virus and discovery of its inhibitors,"© 2023In July 2022, the World Health Organization announced monkeypox as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), and over 85,000 global cases have been reported currently. However, preventive and therapeutic treatments for the monkeypox virus (MPXV) remain limited. MPXV mRNA cap N7 methyltransferase (MTase) is composed of two subunits (E1 C-terminal domain (E1CTD) and E12) which are essential for the replication of MPXV. Here, we solved a 2.16 Å crystal structure of E12. We also docked the D1CTD of the vaccinia virus (VACV) corresponding to the E1CTD in MPXV with E12 and found critical residues at their interface. These residues were further used for drug screening. After virtual screening, the top 347 compounds were screened out and a list of top 20 potential MPXV E12 inhibitors were discovered, including Rutin, Quercitrin, Epigallocatechin, Rosuvastatin, 5-hydroxy-L-Tryptophan, and Deferasirox, etc., which were potential E12 inhibitors. Taking the advantage of the previously unrecognized special structure of MPXV MTase composing of E1CTD and E12 heterodimer, we screened for inhibitors targeting MTase for the first time based on the interface between the heterodimer of MPXV MTase. Our study may provide insights into the development of anti-MPXV drugs.","['Tianjin University', 'Shanxi Medical University', 'Chongqing Medical University']",['China'],"['Shu W.', 'Wang H.-F.', 'Zhou X.', 'Cao J.-M.', 'Wang D.-P.', 'Lin M.-M.', 'Wang M.-Y.', 'Sun Y.-J.', 'Hu W.-S.', 'Zhao R.', 'Cui W.']","['Crystal structure', 'Inhibitors', 'Monkeypox virus', 'N7-methyltransferase E12 subunit', 'Virtual screening']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,35.0,2022
Evaluation of poly(lactic acid) and ECOVIO based biocomposites loaded with antimicrobial sodium phosphate microparticles,"© 2023 The AuthorsHerein, biobased composite materials based on poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) as matrices, sodium hexametaphosphate microparticles (E452i, food additive microparticles, 1 and 5 wt%) as antimicrobial filler and acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC, 15 wt%) as plasticizer, were developed for potential food packaging applications. Two set of composite films were obtained by melt-extrusion and compression molding, i) based on PLA matrix and ii) based on Ecovio® matrix (PLA/PBAT blend). Thermal characterization by thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry demonstrated that the incorporation of E452i particles improved thermal stability and crystallinity, while the mechanical test showed an increase in the Young's modulus. E452i particles also provide antimicrobial properties to the films against food-borne bacteria Listeria innocua and Staphylococcus aureus, with bacterial reduction percentages higher than 50 % in films with 5 wt% of particles. The films also preserved their disintegradability as demonstrated by an exhaustive characterization of the films under industrial composting conditions. Therefore, the results obtained in this work reveal the potential of these biocomposites as appropriated materials for antibacterial and compostable food packaging films.","['Encapsulae S.L.', 'CSIC - Instituto de Ceramica y Vidrio (ICV)', 'CSIC - Instituto de Ciencia y Tecnologia de Polimeros (ICTP)']",['Spain'],"['Fernandez-Garcia M.', 'Munoz-Bonilla A.', 'Fernandez J.F.', 'del Campo A.', 'Reinosa J.J.', 'Mena-Prado I.']","['Antimicrobial', 'Composites', 'Compost', 'PBAT', 'PLA']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,53.0,2023
Revolutionizing medicine with toll-like receptors: A path to strengthening cellular immunity,"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.Toll-like receptors play a vital role in cell-mediated immunity, which is crucial for the immune system's defense against pathogens and maintenance of homeostasis. The interaction between toll-like-receptor response and cell-mediated immunity is complex and essential for effectively eliminating pathogens and maintaining immune surveillance. In addition to pathogen recognition, toll-like receptors serve as adjuvants in vaccines, as molecular sensors, and recognize specific patterns associated with pathogens and danger signals. Incorporating toll-like receptor ligands into vaccines can enhance the immune response to antigens, making them potent adjuvants. Furthermore, they bridge the innate and adaptive immune systems and improve antigen-presenting cells' capacity to process and present antigens to T cells. The intricate signaling pathways and cross-talk between toll-like-receptor and T cell receptor (TCR) signaling emphasize their pivotal role in orchestrating effective immune responses against pathogens, thus facilitating the development of innovative vaccine strategies. This article provides an overview of the current understanding of toll-like receptor response and explores their potential clinical applications. By unraveling the complex mechanisms of toll-like-receptor signaling, we can gain novel insights into immune responses and potentially develop innovative therapeutic approaches. Ongoing investigations into the toll-like-receptor response hold promise in the future in enhancing our ability to combat infections, design effective vaccines, and improve clinical outcomes.","['Chandigarh Group of Colleges', 'Indian Institute of Technology Ropar']",['India'],"['Agrewala J.N.', 'Malik J.A.', 'Kaur G.']","['Cell-mediated immunity', 'T-cell', 'Toll-like receptors', 'vaccines']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Review,0,198.0,2023
Intravenous human dental pulp-derived mesenchymal stem cell therapy for ischemic stroke in rats: an analysis of functional and ischemic brain areas outcomes,"© 2023 by Greggianin et al. for use and distribution according to the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY-NC 4.0) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Cellular therapies have been implicated in treating and rehabilitating ischemic stroke (IS), involving the basic experimental and preclinical areas. Using mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) derived from human dental pulp has shown promising results in animal models, but still with mechanisms and consequences that are not entirely clear. The study aims to evaluate the effects of intravenous MSC on rats with IS regarding neurological function and histological areas of ischemia. Thirty-two male Wistar rats underwent temporary occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (TOMCA) for 60 minutes and were divided into two groups of 16 animals each. One group received dental pulp MSC intravenously, and another received saline 2 hours after TOMCA. The animals were then evaluated using the neurological functionality scales for 15 days, and at the end of the experiment period, the histological areas of cerebral ischemia were analysed. All animals presented ischemic areas and neurological deficits compatible with IS. There was partial recovery of the functionality scores over the evaluation period, and all animals presented focal cerebral ischemia measured by histological analysis; however, there was no statistical difference between the groups. The TOMCA model was effective in reproducing IS. Although we found no difference between treatment groups, our results were useful in showing the pattern of neurological recovery presented by animals treated with dental pulp MSC and the need to extend the evaluation time for a longer period and use more sensitive functional tests. The results add valuable data for improving research with dental pulp MSC in the murine model of IS.",['Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul'],['Brazil'],"['Stefani M.A.', 'Sperling L.E.', 'Malysz T.', 'Greggianin G.F.']","['Cell therapy', 'Ischemic stroke', 'Mesenchymal stem cells', 'Rehabilitation', 'Temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion']",Neuroscience Research Notes,Neurotak Publishing,"['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience', 'Neurology', 'Neuroscience (miscellaneous)']",['NEUR'],Article,0,41.0,2023
PE12 interaction with TLR4 promotes intracellular survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by suppressing inflammatory response,"© 2023 The AuthorsMacrophages serve as the primary immune cells responsible for the innate immune defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection within the host. Specifically, NLRP3, a member of the NLRs family, plays a significant role in conferring resistance against MTB infection. Conversely, MTB evades innate immune killing by impeding the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, although the precise mechanism remains uncertain. In this study, we have identified PE12 (Rv1172c), a member of the PE/PPE family proteins, as an extracellular protein of MTB. PE12 interacts with Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) in macrophages, forming the PE12-TLR4 complex which subsequently inhibits the transcription and expression of NLRP3. As a result, the transcription and secretion of IL-1β are reduced through the PE12-TLR4-NLRP3-IL-1β immune pathway. In vitro and in vivo experiments using a PE12-deficient strain (H37RvΔPE12) demonstrate a weakening of the suppression of the inflammatory response to MTB infection. Our findings highlight the role of the PE12 protein in not only inhibiting the transcription and release of inflammatory cytokines but also mediating the killing of MTB escape macrophages through TLR4 and inducing lung injury in MTB-infected mice. These results provide evidence that PE12 plays a significant role in the inhibition of the host immune response by MTB.",['Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences'],['China'],"['Wang H.', 'Chen F.', 'Liu S.', 'Zhang J.', 'Dang G.', 'Feng T.', 'Zang X.', 'Cui Y.']","['Intracellular survival', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'NLRP3', 'PE12', 'TLR4']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,33.0,2023
Tuning the mechanical properties of pectin films with polyphenol-rich plant extracts,"© 2023 The AuthorsThe mechanical properties of pectin films enhanced with polyphenol-rich fruit extracts were investigated. The scavenging and reducing activity of plant extracts incorporated into the pectin films were determined using bench assays, and their antioxidant activity was correlated with a high presence of polyphenols, which were predominantly comprised of flavonoids and anthocyanins. The pectin films generated from the extracts exhibited a range of mechanical properties; tensile strength (4.99 MPa – 6.91 MPa), elongation at break (45.8 % - 52.3 %), and stiffness (1835 g mm−1 - 2765 g mm−1). To investigate the underlying relationships between plant extract composition and mechanical properties, Projection to Latent Structures (PLS) models were developed. The PLS models revealed that extracts containing high sugar and polyphenol content increase the tensile strength and moisture content of films. The elongation at break of the films was improved or diminished depending on the profile of sugar, acids, and polyphenols in the fruit extracts. Furthermore, the structures and concentration of anthocyanins and flavonoids were identified to strongly influenced the elongation at break differences. By modifying the concentration of sugars, organic acids, and polyphenols, the mechanical properties of pectin-based films can be tuned for tailored applications as food packaging materials.","['The University of Queensland', 'The University of British Columbia']","['Canada', 'Australia']","['Kontogiorgos V.', 'Fitzgerald M.A.', 'Nastasi J.R.']","['Mechanical properties', 'Pectin films', 'Polyphenols']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,74.0,2023
Interpenetrating and semi-interpenetrating network superabsorbent hydrogels based on sodium alginate and cellulose nanocrystals: A biodegradable and high-performance solution for adult incontinence pads,"© 2023Superabsorbent hydrogels (SAHs) are essential in various applications, including hygienic products like adult incontinence pads. However, synthetic-based super absorbent polymers (SAPs) dominate the market despite being non-biodegradable. Alternatively, bio-based hydrogels, such as sodium alginate (SA)-based hydrogels, offer biodegradable alternatives. In this study, we aimed to enhance the practical applied properties of SA-based hydrogels by grafting SA with acrylic acid (AA) and incorporating cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). Specifically, we investigated the potential of interpenetrating network (IPN) and semi-interpenetrating network (S-IPN) hydrogels as absorbent materials in adult incontinence pads. The fabricated SAHs were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). They were also evaluated for absorption and rheological properties. The results showed that in IPN/SAHs, the addition of CNCs decreased pore sizes, while in S-IPN/SAHs, CNC incorporation increased pore sizes. The S-IPN/SAHs exhibited a significantly higher free swelling capacity (FSC) with CNCs loading, reaching 142.29 g/g in 0.9 % NaCl solution and 817.4 g/g in distilled water. On the other hand, IPN/SAHs showed a higher storage modulus and lower loss modulus compared to S-IPN/SAHs. Notably, the superior samples from this study showed a 33 % reduction in SAP consumption compared to commercial SAPs, making them more cost-effective for adult incontinence pad manufacturers. Overall, our research demonstrates the potential of interpenetrating and semi-interpenetrating network superabsorbent hydrogels as high-performance absorbent materials. The results offer improved absorbency and cost savings for producers of adult incontinence pads, and bio-based hydrogels like SA-based hydrogels are promising biodegradable alternatives to synthetic-based SAPs.","['University of Tehran', 'Università di Pisa', 'Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology', 'University of Zabol']","['Italy', 'Iran']","['Danti S.', 'Ismaeilimoghadam S.', 'Jonoobi M.', 'Azimi B.', 'Ashori A.', 'Shahraki A.']","['Adult incontinence pads', 'Cellulose nanocrystal', 'Rheological properties', 'Super absorbent hydrogel']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,44.0,1979
"Structure, aggregation dynamics and crystallization of superfolder green fluorescence protein: Effect of long alkyl chain imidazolium ionic liquids","© 2023Green fluorescent protein (GFP) and its variants are widely used in medical and biological research, especially acting as indicators of protein structural integrity, protein-protein interactions and as biosensors. This study employs superfolder GFP (sfGFP) to investigate the impact of varying alkyl chain length of 1-Cn-3-methylimidazolium chloride ionic liquid (IL) series ([Cnmim]Cl, n = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12) on the protein fluorescence, structure, hydration, aggregation dynamics and crystallization behaviour. The results revealed a concentration-dependent decrease in the sfGFP chromophore, particularly in long alkyl chain ILs ([C10mim]Cl and [C12mim]Cl). Tryptophan (Trp) fluorescence showed the quenching rate increased with longer alkyl chains indicating a nonpolar interaction between Trp57 and the alkyl chain. Secondary structural changes were observed at the high IL concentration of 1.5 M in [C10mim]Cl and [C12mim]Cl. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) indicated relatively stable protein sizes, but with IL aggregates present in [C10mim]Cl and [C12mim]Cl solutions. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) data showed increased protein size and aggregation with longer alkyl chain ILs. Notably, ILs and salts, excluding [C2mim]Cl, promoted sfGFP crystallization. This study emphasizes the influence of the cation alkyl chain length and concentration on protein stability and aggregation, providing insights into utilizing IL solvents for protein stabilization and crystallization purposes.","['Monash University', 'Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences', 'La Trobe University', 'Universidade de São Paulo', 'University of Coimbra, Chemical Process Engineering and Forest Products Research Centre', 'RMIT University']","['Portugal', 'Brazil', 'Australia']","['Verissimo N.V.', 'Bryant G.', 'Pereira J.F.B.', 'Greaves T.L.', 'Han Q.', 'Darmanin C.', 'Drummond C.J.', 'Rosado C.J.']","['Dynamic light scattering', 'Green fluorescent protein', 'Imidazolium chloride', 'Ionic liquids', 'Protein crystallization', 'Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,1,58.0,1979
"Genome-wide analyses of calmodulin and calmodulin-like proteins in the halophyte Nitraria sibirica reveal their involvement in response to salinity, drought and cold stress","© 2023The calmodulin (CaM) and calmodulin-like (CML) proteins are major calcium sensors that play a critical role in environmental stimulus response in plants. Nevertheless, the CaM/CML proteins from the specific plants with extreme tolerance to abiotic stresses remained so far uncharacterized. In this study, 66 candidate proteins (three NsCaMs and sixty-three NsCMLs) were identified from the halophyte Nitraria sibirica, which can withstand an extreme salinity. Bioinformatic analysis of upstream cis-acting elements predicted the potential involvement of NsCaM/CMLs in abiotic stress responses and various hormone responses. Additionally, the Nitraria sibirica transcriptome revealed that 17 and 7 NsCMLs were significantly upregulated under 100 mM or 400 mM NaCl treatment. Transcription of most salt-responsive genes was similarly upregulated under cold stress, yet downregulated under drought treatment. Moreover, predictive subcellular localization analysis suggested that the stress-responsive NsCML proteins mainly localize at the cellular membrane and within the nucleus. Furthermore, transgenic overexpression of two NsCMLs (NISI03G1136 and NISI01G1645) was found to mitigate H2O2 accumulation caused by salt stress. These results provide insights into the potential function of Nitraria sibirica CaM/CML proteins, which could aid the investigation of molecular mechanisms of extreme tolerance to abiotic stresses in halophytes.","['Chinese Academy of Forestry', 'Nanjing Forestry University']",['China'],"['Tang Y.', 'Lu L.', 'Zhu J.', 'Zhang J.', 'Zhu L.', 'Hao Z.', 'Wu X.', 'Shi J.', 'Cheng T.']","['Calmodulin', 'Calmodulin-like protein', 'Halophyte']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,85.0,1979
In situ synthesis of silver nanoparticles with controllable size distribution and high content in bagasse nanocellulose hydrogel,"© 2023Developing an environment-friendly preparation method for silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) composite is significant. However, it remains challenges in size adjustment and content improvement of AgNPs. Here, the NaIO4 oxidation and TEMPO-mediated oxidation were applied to bagasse pulp to prepare nanocellulose (NC) with both carboxyl and aldehyde groups. The aldehyde content of NC could be adjusted in the range of 0.21–1.45 mmol/g by different NaIO4 oxidation times. When the carboxyl groups were protonated, NC with a high length-diameter ratio could construct stable hydrogels in a low concentration at 0.5 wt%. The NC hydrogels showed excellent in situ synthesis ability of AgNPs with abundant pore structure. By regulating the carboxyl group content of NC, the size distribution of synthesized AgNPs could be controlled in the range of 7.14–28.6 nm with high content of 6.79–11.0 %. The NC/AgNPs composite hydrogel exhibited high catalytic degradation activity for 4-nitrophenol and antibacterial activity. This approach for constructing NC hydrogel paves the way for AgNPs composite products with adjustable sizes and high contents.","['Yancheng Institute of Technology', 'Jiangnan University', 'Nanjing Forestry University']",['China'],"['Zhang L.', 'Ke M.', 'Dong W.', 'Jiang J.', 'Zhang W.']","['In situ synthesis', 'Nanocellulose hydrogel', 'Silver nanoparticles']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,40.0,1979
"Enhanced mechanical strength of vortex fluidic mediated biomass-based biodegradable films composed from agar, alginate and kombucha cellulose hydrolysates","© 2023 The AuthorsBiodegradable, biomass derived kombucha cellulose films with increased mechanical strength from 9.98 MPa to 18.18 MPa were prepared by vortex fluidic device (VFD) processing. VFD processing not only reduced the particle size of kombucha cellulose from approximate 2 μm to 1 μm, but also reshaped its structure from irregular to round. The increased mechanical strength of these polysaccharide-derived films is the result of intensive micromixing and high shear stress of a liquid thin film in a VFD. This arises from the incorporation at the micro-structural level of uniform, unidirectional strings of kombucha cellulose hydrolysates, which resulted from the topological fluid flow in the VFD. The biodegradability of the VFD generated polymer films was not compromised relative to traditionally generated films. Both films were biodegraded within 5 days.","['University of Leeds', 'Charles Darwin University', 'Zhejiang Ocean University', 'Flinders University']","['China', 'Australia', 'United Kingdom']","['Wang H.', 'Young D.J.', 'Jellicoe M.', 'He S.', 'Luo X.', 'Zhang Y.', 'Gibson C.T.', 'Raston C.L.', 'Gao J.', 'Wu Y.']","['Biodegradability', 'Biodegradable film', 'Kombucha cellulose hydrolysates', 'Mechanical strength', 'Vortex fluidic device (VFD)']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,44.0,2023
New insights into enhancement of bio-hydrogen production through encapsulated microalgae with alginate under visible light irradiation,"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.The production of green hydrogen is a promising alternative to fossil fuels. The current study focuses on the design of microalgae as a catalyst in bioelectrochemical systems for the generation of biohydrogen. Furthermore, the abovementioned target could be achieved by optimizing different parameters, including strains of microalgae, different optical filters, and their shapes. Synechocystis sp. PAK13 (Ba9), Micractinium sp. YACCYB33 (R4), and Desmodesmus intermedius (Sh42) were used and designed as free cells and immobilized microalgae for evaluating their performance for hydrogen production. Alginate was applied for immobilization not only for protecting the immobilized microalgae from stress but also for inhibiting the agglomeration of microalgae and improving stability. The amount of studied immobilized microalgae was 0.01 g/5 ml algae-dissolved in 10 ml alginate gel at 28 °C, 12 h of light (light intensity 30.4 μmol m−2 s−1), and 12 h of darkness with continual aeration (air bump in every strain flask) at pH = 7.2 ± 0.2 in 0.05 %wuxal buffer which has 3.7 ionic strength. Different modalities, including FTIR, UV, and SEM, were performed for the description of selected microalgae. The surface morphology of Ba9 with alginate composite (immobilized Ba9) appeared as a stacked layer with high homogeneity, which facilitates hydrogen production from water. The conversion efficiencies of the immobilized microalgae were evaluated by incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE). Under optical filters, the optimum IPCE value was ∼ 7 % at 460 nm for immobilized Ba9. Also, its number of hydrogen moles was calculated to be 16.03 mmol h−1 cm−2 under optical filters. The electrochemical stability of immobilized Ba9 was evaluated through repetitive 100 cycles as a short-term stability test, and the curve of chrono-amperometry after 30 min in 0.05 %wuxal at a constant potential of 0.9 V for 30 min of all studied samples confirmed the high stability of all sample and the immobilized Ba9 has superior activity than others.",['Faculty of Sciences'],['Egypt'],"['Elsayed K.N.M.', 'Ibraheem I.B.M.', 'Mohamed F.', 'Khedr N.']","['Alginate', 'Biohydrogen production', 'Immobilized microalgae', 'Photobiovoltaic', 'Synechocystis sp.

Preparation and characterization of zwitterion-substituted lignin/Nafion composite membranes,"© 2023In this study, a novel zwitterion-substituted lignin (ZL) containing amino and sulfonic acid groups was synthesized, and ZL/Nafion composite membranes were fabricated as proton exchange membranes. Kraft lignin was modified using an aminosilane and 1,3-propanesultone via a continuous grafting reaction to provide zwitterionic moieties. Chemical structural analyses confirmed the successful introduction of the zwitterion moiety into lignin. In particular, the surface charge of ZL is positive in an acidic medium and negative in a basic medium, suggesting that ZL is a zwitterionic material. ZL was incorporated into a Nafion membrane to enhance its ion exchange capacity, thermal stability, and hydrophilicity. The proton conductivity of ZL/Nafion 0.5 %, 151.0 mS/cm, was 55.3 % higher than that of unmodified ML (methanol-soluble lignin)/Nafion 0.5 % (97.2 mS/cm), indicating that the zwitterion moiety of ZL enhances the proton transport ability. In addition, oxidative stability evaluation confirmed that ZL/Nafion 2 % was chemically more durable than pure Nafion. This confirmed that using lignin as a membrane additive yielded positive results in terms of chemical durability and oxidation stability in Nafion. Therefore, ZL is expected to be utilized as a multifunctional additive and exhibits the potential for fuel cell applications.","['Kunming University of Science and Technology', 'Kangwon National University']","['South Korea', 'China']","['Youn D.H.', 'An L.', 'Kim Y.S.', 'Kim M.S.', 'Heo J.W.']","['Lignin', 'Nafion', 'Oxidative stability', 'Proton exchange membrane', 'Zwitterion']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,58.0,1979
Novel marine natural products as effective TRPV1 channel blockers,"© 2023Chronic pain management poses a formidable challenge to healthcare, exacerbated by current analgesic options' limitations and adverse effects. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), a non-selective cation channel, has emerged as a promising target for novel analgesics. However, safety and tolerability concerns have constrained the development of TRPV1 modulators. In this study, we explored marine-derived natural products as a source of potential TRPV1 modulators using high-throughput dye-uptake assays. We identified chrexanthomycins, a family of hexacyclic xanthones, exhibited potent TRPV1 inhibitory effects, with compounds cC and cF demonstrating the most significant activity. High-resolution patch-clamp assays confirmed the direct action of these compounds on the TRPV1 channel. Furthermore, in vivo assays revealed that cC and cF effectively suppressed capsaicin-induced pain sensation in mice, comparable to the known TRPV1 inhibitor, capsazepine. Structural-activity relationship analysis highlighted the importance of specific functional groups in modulating TRPV1 activity.

Regenerated bacterial cellulose fibres,"© 2023 The AuthorsThe global shortage of cotton for textile production, forces the exploitation of forests´ lignocellulosic biomass to produce man-made cellulosic fibres (MMCF). This has a considerable environmental impact, pressing the textile industry to search for new sustainable materials and to the development of sustainable recycling processes. Bacterial cellulose (BC), an exopolysaccharide produced by fermentation, could represent such an alternative. In particular, we tested the possibility of improving the mechanical properties of cellulose filaments with a low degree of polymerization (DP) by combining them with high DP from BC, so far exploited to little extent in the textile field. In this work, BC with different degrees of polymerization (DPcuaxam) (BCneat: 927; BCdep:634 and BCblend: 814) were dissolved in N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO) and their spinnability was studied. The rheological behaviour of the dopes was assessed and all were found to be spinnable, at suitable concentrations (BCneat:9.0 %; BCdep:12.2 %; BCblend:10.5 %). A continuous spinning was obtained and the resulting filaments offered similar mechanical performance to those of Lyocell. Further, the blending of BC pulps with different DPs (BCblend, obtained by combining BCneat and BCdep) allowed the production of fibres with higher stiffness (breaking tenacity 56.4 CN.tex−1) and lower elongation (8.29 %), as compared to samples with more homogeneous size distribution (neat BC and depolymerized BC).","['LABBELS—Associate Laboratory', 'Thuringian Institute of Textile and Plastics Research (TITK)', 'Universidade do Minho']","['Portugal', 'Germany']","['Soares Silva F.A.G.', 'Dourado F.', 'Gama M.', 'Meister F.']","['Bacterial cellulose', 'Degree of polymerization', 'Mechanical properties', 'NMMO']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,52.0,2023
Magnetothermal spider silk-based scaffolds for cartilage regeneration,"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.Developing biocompatible, magnetically controlled polymers is a multifunctional solution to many surgical complications. By combining nanoparticle technology with the latest advancements in polymer materials science, we created a multicomponent hybrid system comprised of a robust native spider silk-based matrix; a Mn0.9Zn0.1Fe2O4 nanoparticles coating to provide a controlled thermal trigger for drug release; and liposomes, which act as drug carriers. Fluorescent microscope images show that the dye loaded into the liposomes is released when the system is exposed to an alternating magnetic field due to heating of ferromagnetic nanoparticles, which had a low Curie temperature (40–46°С). The silk matrix also demonstrated outstanding biocompatibility, creating a favorable environment for human postnatal fibroblast cell adhesion, and paving the way for their directed growth.

"Composition, structural properties and immunomodulatory activity of several aqueous Pleurotus β-glucan-rich extracts","© 2023In this work, aqueous extracts from six different Pleurotus species were obtained and their yield, gross composition, β-glucan content, monosaccharide profile, thermal stability, molecular weight distribution, and FT-IR were analyzed before and after purification through ethanol precipitation of the carbohydrate-rich fractions. The bioactivity (anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activity) of the various fractions obtained was also analyzed in three different cell cultures and compared with a lentinan control. The trend observed after purification of the aqueous fractions was an increase in the concentration of polysaccharides (especially β-glucans), a decrease in ash, glucosamine and protein content and the elimination of low molecular weight (Mw) compounds, thus leaving in the purified samples high Mw populations with increased thermal stability. Interestingly, all these purified fractions displayed immunomodulatory capacity when tested in THP-1 macrophages and most of them also showed significant activity in HEK-hTLR4 cells, highlighting the bioactivity observed for Pleurotus ostreatus (both the extracts obtained from the whole mushroom and from the stipes).

Exploring β-glucan as a micro-nano system for oral delivery targeted the colon,"© 2023 The AuthorsThe critical role of oral colon-specific delivery systems (OCDDS) is important for delivering active agents to the colon and rectum specifically via the oral route. The use of micro/nanostructured OCDDS further improves drug stability, bioavailability, and retention time, leading to enhanced therapeutic effects. However, designing micro/nanoscale OCDDSs is challenging due to pH changes, enzymatic degradation, and systemic absorption and metabolism. Biodegradable natural polysaccharides are a promising solution to these problems, and β-glucan is one of the most promising natural polysaccharides due to its unique structural features, conformational flexibility, and specific processing properties. This review covers the diverse chemical structures of β-glucan, its benefits (biocompatibility, easy modification, and colon-specific degradation), and various β-glucan-based micro/nanosized OCDDSs, as well as their drawbacks. The potential of β-glucan offers exciting new opportunities for colon-specific drug delivery.","['Longhua Hospital Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine', 'Zhejiang Shuren University']",['China'],"['Lu Y.', 'Shi Y.', 'Xu X.-L.', 'Chen W.', 'Wu Q.', 'Dong Q.-Q.', 'Yang K.-D.']","['Biocompatibility', 'Colon-targeted', 'Drug delivery', 'Micro/nanosystems', 'β-Glucan']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Review,0,172.0,2023
“Sandwich-like” structure electrostatic spun micro/nanofiber polylactic acid-polyvinyl alcohol-polylactic acid film dressing with metformin hydrochloride and puerarin for enhanced diabetic wound healing,"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.A diabetic wound is a typical chronic wound with a long repair process and poor healing effects. It is an effective way to promote diabetic wound healing to design electrospinning nanofiber films with drug-assisted therapy, good air permeability and, a multilayer functional structure. In this paper, a diabetic wound dressing with a “sandwich-like” structure was designed. Metformin hydrochloride, loaded in the hydrophilic PVA inner layer, could effectively promote diabetic wound healing. The drug release was slowed down by osmosis. The laminate film dressing had good mechanical properties, with tensile strength and elongation at break reaching 5.91 MPa and 90.47 %, respectively, which was close to human skin. The laminate film loaded with erythromycin and puerarin in the hydrophobic PLA outer layer had good antibacterial properties. In addition, due to the high specific surface of the electrostatic spun film, it exhibited high water vapor permeability. It facilitates the gas exchange between the wound and the outside world. The cell experiments proved that the laminate film dressing had good biocompatibility. There was no toxic side effect on cell proliferation. In the diabetic animal wound model, it was shown that the closure rate of diabetic wound repair by laminate film reached 91.11 % in the second week. Our results suggest that the “sandwich-like” nanofiber film dressing could effectively promote the healing process and meet the various requirements of diabetic wound dressing as a promising candidate for future clinical application of chronic wound dressings.","['Southern Medical University', 'Ltd.', 'South China Agricultural University']",['China'],"['Zhou W.', 'Liao M.', 'Wan M.', 'Jian X.', 'Zhao H.', 'Fu X.', 'Zhao Y.', 'Zheng W.', 'Dong X.']","['Diabetic wounds dressing', 'Electrostatic spinning', '“Sandwich-like” structure']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,47.0,2023
Development and optimization of in-situ gel containing chitosan nanoparticles for possible nose-to-brain delivery of vinpocetine,"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.Vinpocetine (VIN), a derivative of vincamine found in the vinca plant, widens blood vessels in the brain and has been shown to improve cognitive function, memory, and cerebrovascular disorders. Nevertheless, the clinical utility of VIN is constrained by factors such as low oral bioavailability owing to the first-pass metabolism that often demands frequent dosing of 3–4 tablets/day. In this regard, the present work aimed to develop VIN-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (VIN-CH-NPs) to surmount these limitations and in view to enhance delivery to the brain of VIN by minimizing systemic exposure. The chitosan (CH) nanoparticles (NP) were developed by ionotropic gelation technique employing tripolyphosphate (TPP) as a cross-linking agent. Employing Design of Experiments (DoE), the effect of CH and TPP concentrations and stirring speed were systematically optimized using Box Behnken design (BBD). The optimized batch of nanoparticles displayed a particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency, and drug loading of 130.6 ± 8.38 nm, +40.81 ± 0.11 mV, 97.56 ± 0.04 %, and 61 ± 0.89 %, respectively. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy indicated the chemical integrity of the drug ruling out the interaction between the VIN and excipients used. DSC and PXRD data indicated that reduction of the crystallinity of VIN in the chitosan matrix. These VIN-CH-NPs manifested good stability, exhibiting an almost spherical morphology. To mitigate rapid mucociliary clearance upon intranasal administration, the optimized VIN-CH-NPs were incorporated into thermosensitive in situ gel (VIN-CHN-ISG). It was observed that the in-situ gel loaded with nanoparticles was opalescent with a pH level of 5.3 ± 0.38. It was also noted that the gelation temperature was 32 ± 0.89 °C, and the gelation time was approximately 15 s. The drug delivery to the brain through the nasal application of optimized VIN-NPs in situ gel was assessed in rats. The results indicated significant nasal application of the in-situ gel nearly doubled the Cmax (P < 0.05) and AUC0-t (P < 0.05) in the brain compared to oral administration. Nasal administration improved drug delivery to the brain by reducing systemic exposure to VIN. A histopathological study of the nasal mucosa revealed no irritation or toxicity, making it safe for nasal administration. These findings suggest that the developed NPs in-situ gel effectively targeted vinpocetine to the brain through the nasal pathway, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for managing Alzheimer's disease.","['KLE College of Pharmacy, Bengaluru']",['India'],"['Shivakumar H.N.', 'Hard S.A.A.A.', 'Redhwan M.A.M.']","[""Alzheimer's treatment"", 'Drug optimization', 'In-situ gels', 'Intranasal delivery', 'Vinpocetine-chitosan nanoparticles']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,67.0,2023
Integrated analysis of genes and long non-coding RNAs in trachea transcriptome to decipher the host response during Newcastle disease challenge in different breeds of chicken,"© 2023 The AuthorsNewcastle disease is a highly infectious economically devastating disease caused by Newcastle disease Virus in Chicken (Gallus gallus). Leghorn and Fayoumi are two breeds which show differential resistance patterns towards NDV. This study aims to identify the differentially expressed genes and lncRNAs during NDV challenge which could play a potential role in this differential resistance pattern. A total of 552 genes and 1580 lncRNAs were found to be differentially expressing. Of them, 52 genes were annotated with both Immune related pathways and Gene ontologies. We found that most of these genes were upregulated in Leghorn between normal and challenged chicken but several were down regulated between different timepoints after NDV challenge, while Fayoumi showed no such downregulation. We also observed that higher number of positively correlating lncRNAs was found to be downregulated along with these genes. This shows that although Leghorn is showing higher number of differentially expressed genes in challenged than in non-challenged, most of them were downregulated during the disease between different timepoints. With this we hypothesize that the downregulation of immune related genes and co-expressing lncRNAs could play a significant role behind the Leghorn being comparatively susceptible breed than Fayoumi.

Folic acid-chitosan functionalized polymeric nanocarriers to treat colon cancer,"© 2023In the present study, polymeric nanoparticles loaded with IRI and quercetin, a p-gp inhibitor, were developed to target folate receptors expressed by colon cancer cells for oral targeted delivery. This work reports the development of PNPs with an entrapment efficiency of 41.26 ± 0.56 % for IRI and 55.83 ± 4.51 for QT. PNPs were further surface modified using chitosan-folic acid conjugates for better targetability to obtain folic acid-chitosan coated nanoparticles. DLS and FeSEM revealed particles in the nanometric size range with spherical morphology, while FTIR and DSC provided details on their structure and encapsulation. In vitro drug release studies confirmed a sustained release pattern of IRI and QT, while cell line studies confirmed the superiority of C-FA-PNPs when tested on Caco2 cells. Pharmacodynamic studies in colon cancer induced rats showed similar efficacy for PNPs and C-FA-PNPs. Further examination from a bio-distribution study in healthy rats, revealed the failure of C-FA-PNPs to deliver the drugs to the colon adequately, while the PNPs improved the available concentration of IRI at the colon by almost 1.8 folds when compared to the available marketed product. Hence, the developed PNP formulation sticks out as a plausible substitute for the intravenous dosage forms of IRI which have been conventionally prevailing.","['Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani', 'University of South Carolina School of Medicine Columbia', 'Manipal College of Pharmaceutical Sciences', 'National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Mohali', 'SVKM’s Dr. Bhanuben Nanavati College of Pharmacy']","['India', 'United States']","['Bhaskar K.V.', 'Verma R.', 'Kumar L.', 'Birangal S.R.', 'Gourishetti K.', 'Jitta S.R.', 'Kulkarni O.P.', 'Hari G.', 'Bhaskaran N.A.', 'Sharma P.', 'Salwa']","['cancer', 'Co-delivery', 'colon', 'Design of experiments', 'Irinotecan', 'P-glycoprotein', 'Polymeric nanoparticles', 'Quercetin']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,57.0,1979
"Characterization of active films of chitosan containing nettle Urtica dioica L. extract: Spectral and water properties, microstructure, and antioxidant activity","© 2023 The AuthorsChitosan films enriched with aqueous nettle extract (Urtica dioica L.) were evaluated by measuring their solubility, equilibrium moisture, water vapor permeability, spectral and antioxidant properties, and microstructure. Nettle extract showed a significant effect on the analyzed film properties. The addition of nettle extract manifested a sharp decrease in water vapor permeability, decreasing from 5.64 · 10−11 to 2.22 · 10−11 g/m·s·Pa. The chitosan- nettle extract films exhibited a high free-radical scavenging activity against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS). Incorporation of nettle extract into the chitosan matrix was successfully carried out to obtain antioxidant films. The results obtained showed that the incorporation of nettle extract allowed obtaining chitosan films with antioxidant properties, including a total phenolic content up to 1.57 mg GAE/g film. Furthermore, the films with nettle extract boast an UV shielding ability with transmittance values close to zero in the UV region and a water solubility up to 1 %.

Supercritical impregnation of starch aerogels with quercetin: Fungistatic effect and release modelling with a compartmental model,"© 2023 The AuthorsThis work proposes the use of supercritical CO2 to impregnate starch (potato and corn) aerogels with quercetin for a potential fungistatic application. Starch aerogels were successfully produced with supercritical drying, but different results were found depending on the amylose/amylopectin ratio. A higher amount of amylose increases aerogels' specific surface area (with a structure with nanofibrils and nodes) due to the linear and amorphous character of this polymer, whereas a higher amount of amylopectin decreases this property until values of only 25 m2·g−1, obtaining an aerogel with a rough surface. These results were explained with XRD, thermogravimetric, and rheological results (triple step with two temperature sweeps and a time sweep and steady state analysis) concerning hydrogel formation. In fact, retrogradation step plays a more important role in hydrogel formation for a starch source with a higher amount of amylopectin due to an increase in the different polymers' interactions. Supercritical impregnation of quercetin on the aerogels was successfully performed (a loading around 0.30 % with respect to the amount of polymer), and in vitro results indicated that the aerogels produced a fungistatic effect on different types of fungi, but only in the first 12 h because the microorganisms adapted to the surrounding environment. Finally, a compartmental model was used to fit the drug release, which is controlled by quercetin aqueous solubility, indicating the main mass transfer resistances (mass transfer through aerogels was always around 500 min−1 and dissolution process mass transfer from 5·10−3 to 1.65·10−3 s−1) and how an increase in the specific surface area of the aerogels (in the case of corn aerogel) provided a stronger initial burst (70–80 % in 20 min). In fact, this initial burst release was mathematically related to a parameter, that varies from 0.178 to 0.036 depending on the aerogel composition. This study shows that starch aerogels can be impregnated with a hydrophobic compound with fungistatic effect by using supercritical CO2, modifying in addition the drug release by changing the native starch.","['Hospital Virgen de la Vega', 'Università degli Studi di Salerno', 'Universidad de Salamanca']","['Italy', 'Spain']","['Tabernero A.', 'Martin del Valle E.', 'Mottola S.', 'Giordano M.', 'Iannone G.', 'De Marco I.', 'Jimenez A.', 'Gonzalez-Garcinuno A.']","['Aerogels', 'Rheological measurements', 'Supercritical fluids', 'Supercritical impregnation']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,41.0,2023
Enzymatically crosslinked magnetic starch-grafted poly(tannic acid) hydrogel for “smart” cancer treatment: An in vitro chemo/hyperthermia therapy study,"© 2023A novel strategy was designed and developed based of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-mediated crosslinking of tyramine-functionalized starch (Tyr-St), tannic acid (TA) and phenolated-magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4-PhOH NPs), and simultaneous loading of doxorubicin hydrochloride (Dox) to afford a pH-responsive magnetic hydrogel-based drug delivery system (DDS) for synergistic in vitro chemo/hyperthermia therapy of human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells. The developed St-g-PTA/Fe3O4 magnetic hydrogel showed porous micro-structure with saturation magnetization (δs) value of 19.2 emu g−1 for Fe3O4 NPs content of ∼7.4 wt%. The pore sizes of the St-g-PTA/Fe3O4 hydrogel was calculated to be 2400 ± 200 nm−2. In vitro drug release experiments exhibited the developed DDS has pH-dependent drug release behavior, while at physiological pH (7.4) released only 30 % of the loaded drug after 100 h. Human serum albumin (HSA) adsorption capacities of the synthesized St/Fe3O4 and St-g-PTA/Fe3O4 magnetic hydrogels were obtained as 86 ± 2.2 and 77 ± 1.9 μgmg−1, respectively.

Alginate/hyaluronic acid-based systems as a new generation of wound dressings: A review,"© 2023Skin is the largest organ of the human body, which acts as a protective barrier against pathogens. Therefore, a lot of research has been carried out on wound care and healing. Creating an ideal environment for wound healing and optimizing the local and systemic conditions of the patient play critical roles in successful wound care. Many products have been developed for improving the wound environment and providing a protected and moist area for fast healing. However, there is still high demand for new systems with high efficiency. The first generation of wound dressings merely covered the wound, while the subsequent/last generations covered it and aided in healing it in different ways. In modern wound dressings, the kind of used materials and their complexity play a crucial role in the healing process. These new systems support wound healing by lowering inflammation, exudate, slough, and bacteria. This study addresses a review of alginate/hyaluronic acid-based wound dressings developed so far as well as binary and ternary systems and their role in wound healing. Our review corroborates that these systems can open up a new horizon for wounds that do not respond to usual treatments and have a long curing period.","['Islamic Azad University, Najafabad Branch']",['Iran'],"['Hassanzadeh-Tabrizi S.A.', 'Zarei N.']","['Alginate', 'Hyaluronic acid', 'Skin', 'Wound dressing']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Review,0,117.0,1979
Development of biomaterials based on chitosan-gelatin nanofibers encapsulated with Ziziphora clinopodioides essential oil and Heracleum persicum extract for extending the shelf-life of vacuum-cooked beef sausages,"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.The aims of the current study were to encapsulate Ziziphora clinopodioides essential oil (ZEO, 0%, 0.15%, and 0.25%) and Heracleum persicum extract (HPE, 0%, 0.25%, and 0.5%) into the chitosan-gelatin (CH-GE) nanofibers through the electrospinning process to improve the shelf-life of vacuum-cooked beef sausages through 70 days of refrigerated storage. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that all nanofibers appeared thin, well-defined, smooth, and possessed uniform thread-like fibers without any beads or nodule formations. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy study confirmed the molecular interaction between encapsulated compounds and CH-GE nanofibers. The X-ray diffraction analysis of nanofibers showed an increase in crystallinity after incorporating ZEO and HPE into the polymer. Treated sausages with CH-GE-ZEO 0.25%-HPE 0.25% and CH-GE-ZEO 0.25%-HPE 0.5% showed significantly lower microbial population and lipid oxidation than the control group during the experiment period (P < 0.05). Sausages formulated with designated CH-GE nanofibers had better microbial, chemical, and sensory properties compared to sausages treated with pure ZEO/HPE during refrigerated storage. The findings also showed that treated sausages with CH-GE-ZEO 0.25%-HPE 0.5% had the highest color, odor, texture, and overall acceptability after 70 days of refrigerated storage conditions. Therefore, this treatment could be applicable for the prolonged storage conditions during cooked beef sausage production.","['Shahrekord University', 'Razi University']",['Iran'],"['Abbasvali M.', 'Mohebi E.', 'Shahbazi Y.']","['Beef sausage', 'Heracleum persicum', 'Ziziphora clinopodioides']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,74.0,2023
Air-brush spray coated Ti3C2-MXene-graphene nanohybrid thin film based electrochemical biosensor for cancer biomarker detection,"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.Cancer is a significant health hazard worldwide and poses a greater threat to the quality of human life. Quantifying cancer biomarkers with high sensitivity has demonstrated considerable potential for compelling, quick, cost-effective, and minimally invasive early-stage cancer detection. In line with this, efforts have been made towards developing an f-graphene@Ti3C2-MXene nanohybrid thin-film-based electrochemical biosensing platform for efficient carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) detection. The air-brush spray coating technique has been utilized for depositing the uniform thin films of amine functionalized graphene (f-graphene) and Ti3C2-MXene nanohybrid on ITO-coated glass substrate. The chemical bonding and morphological studies of the deposited nanohybrid thin films are characterized by advanced analytical tools, including XRD, XPS, and FESEM. The EDC-NHS chemistry is employed to immobilize the deposited thin films with monoclonal anti-CEA antibodies, followed by blocking the non-specific binding sites with BSA.

Bacteriophage entrapped chitosan microgel for the treatment of biofilm-mediated polybacterial infection in burn wounds,"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) bacteria are most commonly present in burn wound infections. Multidrug resistance (MDR) and biofilm formation make it difficult to treat these infections. Bacteriophages (BPs) are proven as an effective therapy against MDR as well as biofilm-associated wound infections. In the present work, a naturally inspired bacteriophage cocktail loaded chitosan microparticles-laden topical gel has been developed for the effective treatment of these infections. Bacteriophages against MDR S. aureus (BPSAФ1) and P. aeruginosa (BPPAФ1) were isolated and loaded separately and in combination into the chitosan microparticles (BPSAФ1-CHMPs, BPPAФ1-CHMPs, and MBP-CHMPs), which were later incorporated into the SEPINEO™ P 600 gel (BPSAФ1-CHMPs-gel, BPPAФ1-CHMPs-gel, and MBP-CHMPs-gel). BPs were characterized for their morphology, lytic activity, burst size, and hemocompatibility, and BPs belongs to Caudoviricetes class. Furthermore, BPSAФ1-CHMPs, BPPAФ1-CHMPs, and MBP-CHMPs had an average particle size of 1.19 ± 0.11, 1.42 ± 0.21, and 2.84 ± 0.28 μm, respectively, and expressed promising in vitro antibiofilm eradication potency. The ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging in infected burn wounds demonstrated improved wound healing reduced inflammation and increased oxygen saturation following treatment with BPs formulations.

"Influence of oxidation, acetylation and hydrothermal treatment on structure and functionality of common buckwheat starch","© 2023The set aim of present work was to investigate the effects of acetylation, oxidation and heat moisture treatment on physicochemical, pasting, gel texture, structural, thermal and morphological properties of common buckwheat starch. Swelling power and solubility of starches reduced after modification except acetylation. Color of buckwheat starch improved after oxidation and acetylation. Paste clarity increased while syneresis reduced following modification with the exception of oxidation. Pasting properties of buckwheat starch revealed increased peak viscosity and breakdown viscosity following modification treatments. Gel texture analysis depicted increased hardness and reduced springiness, chewiness and cohesiveness for modified starches of buckwheat. Diffractograms of starches showed variation in intensity of some bands. Heat moisture treatment increased agglomeration and oxidation caused slight depression on surface of some granules. Relative crystallinity reduced following oxidation and hydrothermal treatment of starch. The gelatinization temperatures were increased in hydrothermal treated starch samples while oxidation and acetylation reduced the gelatinization temperature. The findings of this work would favor the new applications of modified starch from common buckwheat.","['Guru Jambheshwar University of Science &amp; Technology', 'CCS Haryana Agricultural University']",['India'],"['Sindhu R.', 'Khatkar B.S.']","['Acetylation', 'Common buckwheat', 'Heat moisture treatment', 'Oxidation', 'Pasting properties', 'Structural properties']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,38.0,1979
Relay run property of immobilized cholesterol oxidase on magnetic biochar for sterol removal,"© 2023This study investigated the biocatalytic performance of immobilized cholesterol oxidase (CHOD) on magnetite-based carbon (MBC) for degrading cholesterol. The results showed that MBC-CHOD exhibited higher activity and good affinity towards substrate compared to free enzyme and other immobilized enzymes. Mass spectra analysis revealed that MBC-CHOD damaged the main structure of cholesterol, benefitting the further biological treatment. The study proposes a Fenton process mechanism by which H2O2 is transferred to free radicals such as ·OH under acidic conditions, promoting further substrate degradation. This suggests that MBC-CHOD has a relay run property leading to high degradation of cholesterol. Molecular docking indicates that cholesterol preferentially binds to TYR-28 residue and LYS-138 residue in CHOD through hydrogen bonds. Overall, MBC-CHOD proved to be a promising candidate for efficient and sustainable cholesterol degradation.","['University of Shanghai for Science and Technology', 'Shenyang Agricultural University']",['China'],"['Zhang H.', 'Ji J.', 'Liu H.', 'Tang R.', 'Guan G.', 'Zhao Y.', 'Wang Z.', 'Bi H.', 'Wu Y.']","['Fenton process', 'Immobilized enzyme', 'Magnetic biochar']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,19.0,1979

Herein, a multifunctional and self-adaptive double-layer hydrogel was constructed, which was comprised of chitosan-based inner layer hydrogel and gellan gum-based outer layer hydrogel. Various properties of inner layer hydrogel were systematically investigated, including injectability, shape-adaptability, solid-liquid phase transition, biocompatibility, hemostasis, antibacterial performance and anti-inflammatory. Thanks to the phase-transition from solid to liquid at body temperature, inner layer hydrogel exhibited stronger adaptability to fill irregular and deep wounds, in which chitosan was liquefied and its therapeutic effect was maximized. Outer layer hydrogel was fabricated by calcium ions and gellan gum, whose certain mechanical strength could provide protection and a moister environment for wounds.

Antibacterial activity of juglone @ chitosan nanoemulsion against Staphylococcus aureus and its effect on pork shelf life,"© 2023Food poisoning caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) contaminated meat has received a lot of attention. Although juglone has anti-S. aureus properties, its limited water solubility prevents it from being used in food manufacturing. Juglone @ chitosan nanoemulsion (NJ) was produced for the first time in order to increase its solubility. At the same time, it was applied to the pork model. According to the findings, NJ's particle size was 119.30 nm, its polymer dispersity index (PDI) value was 0.290, and its zeta potential was −57.3 mV. And it's stable over a 7-day storage period. The cell shape and membrane integrity of S. aureus were significantly damaged by NJ. At the same time, NJ showed extreme vigor for biofilm removal. The inclusion of NJ coating significantly reduced S. aureus, total volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N), total viable count (TVC), thiobarbituric acid reactants (TBARS), and pH in the sample when using the pork feeding model. NJ, meantime, halted the sensory evaluation's fall in meat score. Additionally, NJ demonstrated good biocompatibility in mouse acute toxicity tests. The aforementioned findings demonstrate that NJ is anticipated to become an anti-S. aureus and a novel method for coating pork preservation.",['Northwest A&amp;F University'],['China'],"['Ma L.', 'Wan Y.', 'Wang X.', 'Li Q.', 'Wang T.', 'Yang L.']","['Biofilm', 'Chitosan', 'Juglone', 'Nanoemulsion', 'Pork preservation', 'Staphylococcus aureus']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,46.0,1979
A comprehensive review of cancer therapies mediated by conjugated gold nanoparticles with nucleic acid,"© 2023Nucleic acids provide a promising therapeutic platform by targeting various cell signaling pathways involved in cancer and genetic disorders. However, maintaining optimal stability during delivery limits their utility. Nucleic acid delivery vehicles are generally categorized into biological and synthetic carriers. Regardless of the efficiency of biological vectors, such as viral vectors, issues related to their immunogenicity and carcinogenesis are very important and vital for clinical applications. On the other hand, synthetic vectors such as lipids or polymers, have been widely used for nucleic acid delivery. Despite their transfection efficiency, low storage stability, targeting inefficiency, and tracking limitations are among the limitations of the clinical application of these vectors. In the past decades, gold nanoparticles with unique properties have been shown to be highly efficient mineral vectors for overcoming these obstacles. In this review, we focus on gold nanoparticle-nucleic acid combinations and highlight their use in the treatment of various types of cancers. Furthermore, by stating the biological applications of these structures, we will discuss their clinical applications.",['Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences'],['Iran'],"['Hosseini S.A.', 'Yaghoobi H.', 'Kardani A.']","['Bioconjugation', 'Cancer', 'Gene delivery', 'Gold nanoparticles', 'Nucleic acid']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Review,0,139.0,1979
Inhibitory effect of daidzein on the calcium-activated chloride channel TMEM16A and its anti-lung adenocarcinoma activity,"© 2023TMEM16A is highly expressed in a variety of tumor cells and is involved in the growth and metastasis of malignancies. It has been established that down-regulation of TMEM16A expression or functional activity can inhibit tumor cells growth. However, there is a lack of targeted inhibitors with high efficiency and low toxicity. Here, we identified a novel inhibitor daidzein from dozens of natural product molecules. Whole-cell patch clamp data indicated that daidzein inhibits TMEM16A channel in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 of 1.39 ± 0.59 μM. Western blot result showed that daidzein can also reduce the expression of TMEM16A protein in LA795 cells. These results indicated that the inhibitory effects of daidzein exert on TMEM16A in two ways, both inhibiting TMEM16A current and decreasing its protein expression. In addition, the putative binding sites of daidzein on TMEM16A are G608, G628, and K839 through molecular docking. Moreover, daidzein concentration-dependently reduced cell viability and cell migration, causing G1/S cell cycle arrest in vitro. It was also confirmed that daidzein can effectively inhibit the growth of LA795 lung adenocarcinoma cells implanted nude mice in vivo. In conclusion, daidzein can be used as a lead compound for the development of therapeutic drugs for lung adenocarcinoma.","['Hebei Medical University', 'Hebei University of Technology']",['China'],"['Hao A.', 'Sun Y.', 'Elena V.', 'Zhang H.', 'Wang X.', 'Zhan Y.', 'An H.', 'Song G.', 'Chen Y.']","['Daidzein', 'Lung adenocarcinoma', 'TMEM16A']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,38.0,1979
Enhancing the stability of natural anthocyanins against environmental stressors through encapsulation with synthetic peptide-based gels,"© 2023 The Author(s)The instability of anthocyanin to environmental stressors severely limits its applications as a natural bioactive pigment. To overcome these limitations, this proof-of-concept study utilizes the high biocompatibility of peptide molecules and the unique gel microstructure to develop innovative peptide-based gels. Characterization of the gels was conducted through AFM, SEM, rheological analysis, and CD spectrum. These analyses confirmed the fibrous mesh structure and impressive mechanical strength of the peptide-based gels. The cytotoxicity evaluation using MTT and hemolysis analysis showed high biocompatibility. Encapsulation efficiency analysis and fluorescence microscopy images demonstrated successful and efficient encapsulation of anthocyanins in all four peptide-based gels, with uniform distribution. Moreover, systematic investigations were conducted to assess the impact of peptide-based gels on the stability of natural anthocyanins under environmental stressors such as temperature, pH variations, and exposure to metal ions. Notably, the results revealed a significant enhancement in stability, including improved long-term storage and antioxidant activity. In conclusion, this study successfully developed four novel peptide-based gels that effectively protect natural anthocyanins from environmental stressors, highlighting their potential in various fields such as food and biology.",['Xihua University'],['China'],"['Linli F.', 'Yang W.', 'Li W.', 'Chen X.']","['Anthocyanin', 'Peptide', 'Peptide gel', 'Stability']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,50.0,2023
Glucose-regulated protein 94 facilitates the proliferation of the Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus via inhibiting apoptosis,"© 2023Glucose regulatory protein 94 (GRP94) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident member of the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) family, that plays an important role in secreted protein folding. Bombyx mori nuclear polyhedrosis virus (BmNPV) is one of the main pathogens in sericulture, causing serious economic losses every year. Previous studies showed that HSP90 members promote BmNPV replication in silkworm, but the function of BmGRP94 in BmNPV infection and proliferation is still not understood. In this study, we investigated the interplay between BmGRP94 and BmNPV infection in silkworm. We first identified a single gene of BmGRP94 in the Bombyx mori genome, which encodes a polypeptide with 810 amino acids in length. Spatio-temporal expression profiles showed that BmGRP94 was highly expressed in hemocytes and midgut, and was significantly induced by BmNPV infection. Furthermore, overexpression of BmGRP94 facilitates viral proliferation, while BmGRP94 inhibition evidently decreased BmNPV proliferation in BmN cells and in silkworm midgut. Mechanistically, BmGRP94 inhibition triggers ER stress, as judged by increased expression of PERK/ATF4/ERO1, H2O2 production, and ER calcium efflux, which promotes cell apoptosis to restrict BmNPV replication in silkworm. These results suggest that BmGRP94 plays an important role in facilitating BmNPV proliferation, and provides a potential molecular target for BmNPV prevention.","['Anhui Agricultural University', 'Chengdu Normal University']",['China'],"['Lu Y.', 'Xu J.', 'Zhang H.', 'Huang S.', 'Xie X.', 'Afrasiyab', 'Li D.', 'Ai H.', 'Jiang X.']","['BmNPV', 'GRP94', 'PERK']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,41.0,1979
A fully bio-based soy protein wood adhesive modified by citric acid with high water tolerance,"© 2023Despite the widespread application prospect of soybean meal flour (SF) as a non-toxic and renewable wood adhesive, the practical application is limited by its poor mechanical properties and water resistance. In this work, a novel SF-based wood adhesive (CSP) was developed using citric acid (CA) as a modifier, which was further designated to produce plywood on a laboratory scale. Moreover, the effects of the mass ratio of CA/SF, hot-pressing temperature, and hot-pressing time on the bonding properties and water resistance of the resulting plywood were investigated in detail. As a result, under the optimal hot-pressing conditions (180 °C, 5 min), high-performance plywood bonded by CSP (CA/SF = 15/100) adhesive was fabricated, whose dry shear strength, cold-water wet shear strength (20 °C for 24 h), and hot-water wet shear strength (63 °C for 3 h) reached 1.65 MPa, 1.99 MPa, and 1.58 MPa, respectively. Due to the easy preparation process, sustainability, and favorable properties, the proposed fully bio-based CSP wood adhesive has great potential for the large-scale fabrication of eco-friendly wood panels in industry.","['Southwest Forestry University', 'Zhejiang Agriculture and Forestry University']",['China'],"['Du G.', 'Xi X.', 'Lei H.', 'Li C.', 'Hao Z.', 'Xu G.', 'Hou D.']","['Bonding properties', 'Plywood', 'Soybean meal flour', 'Water resistance', 'Wood adhesive']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,54.0,1979
"Probiotic-loaded edible films made from proteins, polysaccharides, and prebiotics as a quality factor for minimally processed fruits and vegetables: A review","© 2023 Elsevier B.V.Minimally processed fruits and vegetables (MPFVs) are gaining popularity in households because of their freshness, convenience, and rapid consumption, all of which align with today's busy lifestyles. However, their exposure of large surface areas during peeling and slicing can result in contamination by foodborne pathogens and spoilage bacteria, posing potential food safety concerns. In addition, enzymatic browning of MPFVs can significantly reduce their consumer appeal. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt certain methods to protect MPFVs. Recent studies have shown that utilizing biopolymer-based edible films containing probiotics is a promising approach to preserving MPFVs. These active food packaging films exhibit barrier function, antioxidant function, and antimicrobial function while protecting the viability of probiotics, which is essential to maintain the nutritional value and quality of MPFVs. This paper reviews microbial contamination in MPFVs and the preparation of probiotic-loaded edible films with common polysaccharides (alginate, gellan gum, and starch), proteins (zein, gelatin, and whey protein isolate), prebiotics (oligofructose, inulin, and fructooligosaccharides). It also explores the potential application of probiotic-loaded biopolymer films/coatings on MPFVs, and finally examines the practical application requirements from a consumer perspective.","['Indiana University Bloomington', 'Henan Agricultural University', ""Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China"", 'Northwest A&amp;F University', 'Sun Yat-Sen University', 'Henan University of Technology']","['United States', 'China']","['Tang J.', 'Du G.', 'Shao K.', 'Zhao X.', 'Liu B.', 'Chang S.', 'Guo Q.']","['Edible films and coatings', 'Minimally processed fruits and vegetables', 'Probiotics']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Review,0,130.0,2023
Enhancing interfacial interaction and crystallization in polylactic acid-based biocomposites via synergistic effect of wood fiber and self-assembly nucleating agent,"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.Incorporation of natural fibers into polylactic acid (PLA) provides a feasible pathway to improve the performance of PLA with a low environmental impact. However, the insufficient interfacial adhesion between fiber and matrix limits the reinforcement efficiency of fiber and final mechanical properties of the biocomposites. Herein we reported an efficient method to simultaneously enhance interfacial interaction, crystallization and mechanical performance of PLA-based biocomposites via combination of wood fiber (WF) and a self-assembly nucleating agent (TMC-300). The interactions between WF and TMC-300 and its influence on PLA, including interfacial crystal morphology, crystallization behavior, and mechanical performance were studied. The results showed that TMC-300 could self-assemble into dendritic-like structure on WF surface driven by hydrogen bonding, inducing the epitaxial crystallization of PLA. This unique interfacial crystallization integrated PLA matrix with WF, resulting in better interfacial adhesion. Under the optimal TMC-300 content (0.5 wt%), the flexural strength and notched impact strength of PLA composites increased by 10 % and 69 % compared with neat PLA, respectively. Additionally, TMC-300 and WF synergistically functioned as effective nucleating agents, which significantly accelerated the crystallization rate and improved the crystallinity of PLA.

Preferential formation of stereocomplex crystals in poly(L-lactic acid)/poly(D-lactic acid) blends by a fullerene nucleator,"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.Selective formation of stereocomplex (sc) crystallization in enantiomeric poly(L-lactic acid)/poly(D-lactic acid) (PLLA/PDLA) blends is considered as one of the most effective and promising way to improve the mechanical and thermal properties of polylactide (PLA) materials. However, homocrystallization (hc) prevails over sc crystallization in high-molecular-weight (HMW) PLLA/PDLA blends. Herein, we propose a simple and straightforward approach for fabricating sc crystallization and suppress hc crystallization for HMW PLLA/PDLA blends through the addition of C70 as a nucleator. Non-isothermal crystallization and wide-angel X-ray diffraction studies demonstrate that, the incorporation of 1 wt% C70 overwhelmingly leads to the formation of sc crystallites, while preventing the formation of hc crystallites. Isothermal crystallization experiments at 140 °C reveal a significant reduction in the half-crystallization period of the PLLA/PDLA blend upon the addition of C70. Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy suggests that, the improved intermolecular interactions between PLLA and PDLA chains, as well as the inhibition of molecular chain diffusion and mobility, contribute to the accelerated formation of sc facilitated by C70. The enhanced sc crystallization results in a 15.5 °C higher thermal stability in the as-prepared PLLA/PDLA blend with 1 wt% C70 compared to the neat counterpart.",['Shandong University of Technology'],['China'],"['Peng H.', 'Niu J.', 'Rong W.', 'Chang W.-W.']","['Crystallization', 'Fullerene', 'Poly(lactic acid)', 'Stereocomplex']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,48.0,2023
Super-wetting and self-cleaning polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate nanofiber membrane decorated with MIL-88A(Fe) for efficient oil/water emulsion separation and dye degradation,"© 2023Membrane separation is considered an effective approach to water purification. Nevertheless, membrane fouling dramatically decreases the separation efficiency and lifetime of membranes, thus limiting its further development and application. Herein, a multifunctional self-cleaning MIL-88A(Fe) decorated polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (MIL-88A(Fe)@PVA-SA) nanofiber membrane was prepared by electrospinning and in-situ growth methods for the separation of oil/water emulsions and photo-Fenton degradation of dyes. The membrane possesses superhydrophilicity with a water contact angle (WCA) of 0° and superoleophobicity with underwater oil contact angle (UCA) of 161.7°, and exhibits superior separation efficiency (>99.5 %) and permeation flux (1140–2455 L/m2/h) for different oil/water emulsions. Moreover, the membrane exhibited an outstanding photo-Fenton performance under visible light, with degradation efficiencies (~99.9 %) towards methylene blue (MB) and reactive red 24 (RR24) within 90 min. Importantly, the membrane can be easily regenerated by simple rinsing and photo-Fenton self-cleaning treatment. In this study, MIL-88A(Fe)@PVA-SA nanofiber membrane has a promising application in dye removal and oil/water separation, providing a new idea to develop novel membrane materials.","['Qingdao University', 'Tiangong University', 'Yantai Nanshan University']",['China'],"['Jiang X.', 'Zhou B.', 'Wang J.']","['MIL-88A(Fe)', 'Nanofiber membrane', 'Oil/water emulsion separation', 'Photo-Fenton', 'Self-cleaning']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,65.0,1140
"Development of functional, sustainable pullulan-sodium alginate-based films by incorporating essential oil microemulsion for chilled pork preservation","© 2023 Elsevier B.V.Developing safe, eco-friendly, and functionally edible packaging materials has attracted global attention. Essential oils, can be incorporated into packaging materials as antioxidant and antibacterial agents. However, their high volatility and discontinuous film matrix issues may cause a rough film surface, limiting the application in food packaging. In this study, thyme essential oil microemulsion (TEO-M) was prepared and incorporated into a pullulan-sodium alginate (PS) film. The TEO-M incorporation endowed the PS film with antioxidant and UV protection properties. The antioxidant activities of the TEO-M-incorporated PS film were significantly better than those of the TEO-C (thyme essential oil coarse emulsion)-incorporated PS film. In comparison to TEO-C, the distribution of TEO-M in the film is more uniform. Lipid oxidation and the growth of microorganisms in chilled pork were inhibited by incorporating TEO-M at a concentration of 50 mg/mL in the PS film (PS-50M). After 10 days of storage at 4 °C, the total viable count (TVC) of chilled pork preserved in the PS-50M material was significantly reduced compared to the control group (P < 0.05). This study shows that incorporating TEO-M in the PS film provides a method for applying essential oils in food packaging, which may have great potential in the food industry.","['Tianjin University', 'Shaanxi Normal University', 'Ltd.', 'Tianjin University of Science &amp; Technology', 'Shanxi Agricultural University']",['China'],"['Cui F.', 'Wei Z.', 'Sun K.', 'Feng X.', 'Huang L.', 'Kong Q.', 'Gao J.', 'Wu R.', 'Guo J.']","['Chilled pork', 'Functional packaging', 'Microemulsion', 'Preservation', 'Thyme essential oil']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,60.0,2023
Biofilm formation initiating rotifer-specific biopolymer and its predicted components,"© 2023 The AuthorsThe rotifer-specific biopolymer, namely Rotimer, is a recently discovered group of the biomolecule family. Rotimer has an active role in the biofilm formation initiated by rotifers (e.g., Euchlanis dilatata or Adineta vaga) or in the female-male sexual interaction of monogononts. To understand the Ca2+- and polarity-dependent formation of this multifunctional viscoelastic material, it is essential to explore its molecular composition. The investigation of the rotifer-enhanced biofilm and Rotimer-inductor conglomerate (RIC) formation yielded several protein candidates to predict the Rotimer-specific main components. The exudate of E. dilatata males was primarily applied from different biopolimer-containing samples (biofilm or RIC). The advantage of males over females lies in their degenerated digestive system and simple anatomy. Thus, their exudate is less contaminated with food and endosymbiont elements. The sequenced and annotated genome and transcriptome of this species opened the way for identifying Rotimer proteins by mass spectrometry. The predicted rotifer-biopolymer forming components are SCO-spondins and 14–3-3 protein. The characteristics of Rotimer are similar to Reissner's fiber, which is found in the central nervous system of vertebrates and is mainly formed from SCO-spondins. This molecular information serves as a starting point for its interdisciplinary investigation and application in biotechnology, biomedicine, or neurodegeneration-related drug development.","['Pécsi Tudományegyetem', 'Hungarian Centre of Excellence for Molecular Medicine', 'Szegedi Tudományegyetem (SZTE)', 'University of Minnesota Crookston', 'Szegedi Tudományegyetem Általános Orvostudományi Kar', 'Szegedi Biológiai Kutatóközpontjának', 'University of Szeged Faculty of Science and Informatics']","['United States', 'Hungary']","['Vedelek B.', 'Kalman J.', 'Dingmann B.J.', 'Galik-Olah Z.', 'Gyenesei A.', 'Vedelek V.', 'Hunyadi-Gulyas E.', 'Urban P.', 'Galik B.', 'Darula Z.', 'Datki Z.', 'Sinka R.']","['14–3-3 protein', 'Biofilm', 'Rotimer', 'SCO-spondin']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,86.0,2023
Microscopy and modelling investigations on the morphology of the biofilm exopolysaccharide produced by Burkholderia multivorans strain C1576,"© 2023Bacteria form very often biofilms where they embed in a self-synthesized matrix exhibiting a gel-like appearance. Matrices offer several advantages, including defence against external threats and the easiness of intercellular communication. In infections, biofilm formation enhances bacteria resistance against antimicrobials, causing serious clinical problems for patients' treatments. Biofilm matrices are composed of proteins, extracellular DNA, and polysaccharides, the latter being the major responsible for matrix architecture. The repeating unit of the biofilm polysaccharide synthesized by Burkholderia multivorans strain C1576 contains two mannoses and two sequentially linked rhamnoses, one of them 50 % methylated on C-3. Rhamnose, a 6-deoxysugar, has lower polarity than other common monosaccharides and its methylation further reduces polarity. This suggests a possible role of this polysaccharide in the biofilm matrix; in fact, computer modelling and atomic force microscopy studies evidenced intra- and inter-molecular non-polar interactions both within polysaccharides and with aliphatic molecules. In this paper, the polysaccharide three-dimensional morphology was investigated using atomic force microscopy in both solid and solution states. Independent evidence of the polymer conformation was obtained by transmission electron microscopy which confirmed the formation of globular compact structures. Finally, data from computer dynamic simulations were used to model the three-dimensional structure.","['Cornell University', 'Northwestern University', 'Università degli Studi di Trieste']","['Italy', 'United States']","['Syrgiannis Z.', 'Jou I.A.', 'Cescutti P.', 'Brady J.W.', 'Bellich B.', 'De Zorzi R.', 'Bertoncin P.', 'Cacioppo M.', 'Rizzo R.']","['Burkholderia multivorans biofilm', 'Polysaccharide AFM', 'Polysaccharide functions', 'TEM and modelling']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,28.0,1979
Expression of bone morphogenetic protein 10 and its role in biomineralization in Hyriopsis cumingii,"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.Shells and pearls are the products of biomineralization of shellfish after ingesting external mineral ions. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play a role in a variety of biological function, and the genes that encode them, are considered important shell-forming genes in mollusks and are associated with shell and pearl formation, embryonic development, and other functions, but bone morphogenetic protein 10 (BMP10) is poorly understood in Hyriopsis cumingii. In this study, we cloned Hc-BMP10 and obtained a 2477 bp full-length sequence encoding 460 amino acids with a conserved TGF-β structural domain. During the embryonic developmental stages, the cleavage stage had the highest expression of Hc-BMP10, followed by juvenile clams; the expression in the mantle gradually decreased with increasing mussel age. A strong signal was detected on epidermal cells on the mantle edge by in situ hybridization. In both the shell notching and inserting operations of the pearl fragment assay, we found that the expression of Hc-BMP10 increased after the above treatments. RNA interference assays showed that the silencing of Hc-BMP10 resulted in a change in the morphology of the prismatic layer and nacreous layer, with the prismatic layer less closely aligned and the disordered aragonite flakes in the nacreous layer. These findings indicate that Hc-BMP10 is involved in the growth and development of H. cumingii, as well as the formation of shells and pearls. Therefore, this study provides some reference for selecting superior species for growth and pearl breeding of H. cumingii at a molecular level and further investigation of the molecular mechanism for biomineralization of Hc-BMP10.","['Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Aquaculture', 'Shanghai Ocean University', 'National Demonstration Center for Experimental Fisheries Science Education']",['China'],"['Mao Y.', 'Wang Y.', 'Miao Y.', 'Wu C.', 'Wang X.', 'Zhu X.', 'Wang G.', 'Duan S.']","['Biomineralization', 'Bone morphogenetic protein 10', 'Hyriopsis cumingii']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,53.0,2023
Application of enzymes for targeted removal of biofilm and fouling from fouling-release surfaces in marine environments: A review,"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.Biofouling causes adverse issues in underwater structures including ship hulls, aquaculture cages, fishnets, petroleum pipelines, sensors, and other equipment. Marine constructions and vessels frequently are using coatings with antifouling properties. During the previous ten years, several alternative strategies have been used to combat the biofilm and biofouling that have developed on different abiotic or biotic surfaces. Enzymes have frequently been suggested as a cost-effective, substitute, eco-friendly, for conventional antifouling and antibiofilm substances. The destruction of sticky biopolymers, biofilm matrix disorder, bacterial signal interference, and the creation of biocide or inhibitors are among the catalytic reactions of enzymes that really can successfully prevent the formation of biofilms. In this review we presented enzymes that have antifouling and antibiofilm properties in the marine environment like α-amylase, protease, lysozymes, glycoside hydrolase, aminopeptidases, oxidase, haloperoxidase and lipases. We also overviewed the function, benefits and challenges of enzymes in removing biofouling. The reports suggest enzymes are good candidates for marine environment. According to the findings of a review of studies in this field, none of the enzymes were able to inhibit the development of biofilm by a site marine microbial community when used alone and we suggest using other enzymes or a mixture of enzymes for antifouling and antibiofilm purposes in the sea environment.",['University of Hormozgan'],['Iran'],"['Homaei A.', 'Karyani T.Z.', 'Ghattavi S.']","['Antibiofilm', 'Antifouling', 'Enzymes', 'Marine environment']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Review,0,142.0,2023
Formulation and characterization of 3D printed chickpea protein isolate-mixed cereal dysphagia diet,"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.The feasibility study of making 3D printed dysphagia diet was undertaken.

Influence of enzymatic modification on the basis of improved extrusion cooking technology (IECT) on the structure and properties of corn starch,"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.Enzymatic modification can directly affect the structure and properties of starch, but generally causes high energy consumption in drying process. Improved extrusion cooking technology (IECT) itself is a starch modification technology. In this work, a co-extrusion method of starch with 42 % moisture and enzyme was adopted to reveal the effects of different enzyme dosages on the structure and properties of corn starch. After enzyme treatment on the basis of IECT, starch granules were broken into fragments without the occurrence of clear Maltese cross. R1047/1022 and R995/1022 values, peak intensity of Raman spectra and gelatinization temperature decreased, and the full width at half maximum at 480 cm−1 of Raman spectra raised. Moreover, the bound water proportion decreased from 87.44 % to 85.84 % ∼ 78.67 %, and the maximum light transmittance and dextrose equivalent values increased to 34.13 % and 26.14, respectively.

Novel function of the PsDMAP1 protein in regulating the growth and pathogenicity of Phytophthora sojae,"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.The DNA methyltransferase 1-associated protein (DMAP1) was initially identified as an activator of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), a conserved eukaryotic enzyme involved in diverse molecular processes, including histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling. However, the roles and regulatory mechanisms of DMAP1 in filamentous pathogens are still largely unknown. Here, employing bioinformatic analysis, we identified PsDMAP1 in P. sojae, which features a canonical histone tail-binding domain, as the ortholog of the human DMAP1. A phylogenetic analysis of DMAP1 protein sequences across diverse eukaryotic organisms revealed the remarkable conservation and distinctiveness of oomycete DMAP1 orthologs. Homozygous knockout of PsDMAP1 resulted in the mortality of P. sojae. Furthermore, silencing of PsDMAP1 caused a pronounced reduction in mycelial growth, production of sporangia and zoospore, cystospore germination, and virulence. PsDMAP1 also played a crucial role in the response of P. sojae to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and osmotic stresses. Moreover, PsDMAP1 interacted with DNA N6-methyladenine (6 mA) methyltransferase PsDAMT1, thereby enhancing its catalytic activity and effectively regulating 6 mA abundance in P. sojae. Our findings reveal the functional importance of PsDAMP1 in the development and infection of P. sojae, and this marks the initial exploration of the novel 6 mA regulator PsDMAP1 in plant pathogens.","['University of Maine', 'China Agricultural University', 'Northwest A&amp;F University']","['United States', 'China']","['Zhang C.', 'Chen S.', 'Zhang F.', 'Hao J.', 'Liu X.', 'Cui T.', 'Dai T.']","['6 mA methylation', 'Phytophthora sojae', 'SANT domain', 'Stress tolerance', 'Virulence']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,57.0,2023
Assessment of biodegradation of lignocellulosic fiber-based composites – A systematic review,"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.Lignocellulosic fiber-reinforced polymer composites are the most extensively used modern-day materials with low density and better specific strength specifically developed to render better physical, mechanical, and thermal properties. Synthetic fiber-reinforced composites face some serious issues like low biodegradability, non-environmentally friendly, and low disposability. Lignocellulosic or natural fiber-reinforced composites, which are developed from various plant-based fibers and animal-based fibers are considered potential substitutes for synthetic fiber composites because they are characterized by lightweight, better biodegradability, and are available at low cost. It is very much essential to study end-of-life (EoL) conditions like biodegradability for the biocomposites which occur commonly after their service life. During biodegradation, the physicochemical arrangement of the natural fibers, the environmental conditions, and the microbial populations, to which the natural fiber composites are exposed, play the most influential factors. The current review focuses on a comprehensive discussion of the standards and assessment methods of biodegradation in aerobic and anaerobic conditions on a laboratory scale. This review is expected to serve the materialists and technologists who work on the EoL behaviour of various materials, particularly in natural fiber-reinforced polymer composites to apply these standards and test methods to various classes of biocomposites for developing sustainable materials.","['KPR Institute of Engineering and Technology', ""King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok"", 'Kalaignarkarunanidhi Institute of Technology']","['India', 'Thailand']","['Siengchin S.', 'Kumar P.S.', 'Ramesh M.', 'Rajeshkumar L.', 'Sanjay M.R.']","['Analysis', 'Biodegradability standards', 'Biodegradation', 'Natural fiber composites']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Review,0,239.0,2023
"Acetylated rice starch nanocrystals improved the physical, mechanical, and structural properties of native rice starch based films","© 2023Rice starch nanocrystals (SNC) and acetylated rice starch nanocrystals (ASNC) with three different substitution degrees (DS) for 0.22 (ASNCa), 0.56 (ASNCb), and 0.83 (ASNCc), respectively, were synthesized. Starch nanocrystals (SNC, ASNCa, ASNCb and ASNCc) with varying concentrations (0–25 %) were used in the production of composite rice starch-based films plasticized with glycerol using the solvent casting technique. Films were compared concerning their morphology, moisture content and solubility, transmittance, tensile strength, elongation at break. The SNC and ASNC content and acetylated DS had a significant effect (p ≤ 0.05) on all the properties investigated when compared to the control film. The addition of ASNC resulted in less hydrophilic films and UV light barrier properties, and the addition of SNC and ASNC increased the rigidity of starch film. There was an increase of 156.7 % in tensile strength for 10 % ASNCc composite films and a reduction of 68.1 % in water vapor permeability for 20 % ASNCc composite films. The rice starch/ASNCb nanocomposite films with the addition of 5 % and 10 % ASNCb exhibited a compact, smooth, and flat surface structure. Therefore, these results showed that ASNC significantly improved the mechanical properties, surface morphology and thermal stability of the films.","['Shanxi Technology and Business College', 'Central South University of Forestry and Technology']",['China'],"['Lin Q.', 'Xiao H.', 'Liu G.-Q.', 'Wei Y.', 'Yang F.', 'Zhang Q.', 'Huang Z.', 'Zhu D.', 'Li J.']","['Acetylated starch nanocrystals', 'Film property', 'Nanocomposite films', 'Starch nanocrystals']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,47.0,1979
Biosynthesized silver nanoparticles-capped chondroitin sulfate nanogel targeting microbial infections and biofilms for biomedical applications,"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.Medical devices are essential for patient care, but they can also serve as havens for dangerous microbes and the development of biofilm, which can lead to serious infections and higher death rates. To meet these issues, it is crucial to develop novel and effective antimicrobial coatings for medical devices. In this context, we have developed a new biofunctionalized nanosilver (ICS-Ag), employing itaconyl-chondroitin sulfate nanogel (ICSNG) as a synergistic reducing and stabilizing agent, to effectively eradicate microbial infections and biofilm formation. The antibacterial investigations showed that ICS-Ag nanocomposite is an intriguing antibiotic with excellent antibacterial indices (MIC/MBC (μg/mL): 2.29/4.58, 1.25/2.50, and 1.36/1.36 against S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa, respectively), as well as antifungal capacity. Furthermore, ICS-Ag demonstrated efficacy superior to that of the antibiotic (ciprofloxacin, Cipro) against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial biofilms. TEM images of untreated and treated bacterial strains demonstrate synergistic actions that harm the bacterial cytomembrane, leading to the release of intracellular contents and bacterial death. Interestingly, ICS-Ag shows excellent biocompatibility, with an IC50 value (71.25 μg/mL) higher than MICs against tested microbes. Overall, the ICS-Ag film may provide multifunctional antimicrobial coatings for medical equipment to reduce microbial contamination and biofilm development.","['King Abdulaziz University', 'King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences']",['Saudi Arabia'],"['Alharbi N.M.', 'Yahya R.']","['Antimicrobial and anti-biofilm', 'Itaconyl-chondroitin sulfate nanogel', 'Nanosilver-loaded nanogel']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,54.0,2023
MaNAC19–MaXB3 regulatory module mediates sucrose synthesis in banana fruit during ripening,"© 2023Sucrose, a predominant sweetener in banana (Musa acuminata) fruit, determines sweetness and consumer preferences. Although sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) is known to catalyze starch conversion into sucrose in banana fruit during the ripening process, the SPS regulatory mechanism during ripening still demands investigation. Hence, this study discovered that the MaSPS1 expression was promoted during ethylene-mediated ripening in banana fruit. MaNAC19, recognized as the MaSPS1 putative binding protein using yeast one-hybrid screening, directly binds to the MaSPS1 promoter, thereby transcriptionally activating its expression, which was verified by transient overexpression experiments, where the sucrose synthesis was accelerated through MaNAC19-induced transcription of MaSPS1. Interestingly, MaXB3, an ethylene-inhibited E3 ligase, was found to ubiquitinate MaNAC19, making it prone to proteasomal degradation, inhibiting transactivation of MaNAC19 to MaSPS1, thereby attenuating MaNAC19-promoted sucrose accumulation. This study's findings collectively illustrated the mechanistic basis of a MaXB3-MaNAC19-MaSPS1 regulatory module controlling sucrose synthesis during banana fruit ripening. These outcomes have broadened our understanding of the regulation mechanisms that contributed to sucrose metabolism occurring in transcriptional and post-transcriptional stages, which might help develop molecular approaches for controlling ripening and improving fruit quality.",['South China Agricultural University'],['China'],"['Lu W.-J.', 'Shan W.', 'Yang Y.-Y.', 'Chen J.-Y.', 'Wei W.', 'Kuang J.-F.', 'Wu C.-J.']","['Banana fruit', 'E3 ligase', 'Ethylene', 'NAC', 'Ripening', 'Sucrose synthesis']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,55.0,1979
A self-gelling hydrogel based on thiolated hyaluronic acid for three-dimensional culture of ovine preantral follicles,"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.Three-dimensional (3D) ovarian follicle culture offers a promising option for fertility preservation in patients who cannot receive ovarian tissue transplantation. Our research evaluated the potential of a hydrogel composed of thiolated hyaluronic acid (HA-SH) for ovine preantral follicle development compared to routinely used alginate hydrogel (ALG). Synthesized via a carbodiimide reaction, HA-SH facilitated a self-crosslinking hydrogel through disulfide bond formation. Ovine preantral follicles (200-300 μm) retrieved through mechanical and enzymatic methods were encapsulated individually in either ALG or HA-SH hydrogels. Although both hydrogels adequately supported follicle survival, 3D integrity, and antrum formation over a 17-day in vitro culture, follicle growth was significantly higher within the HA-SH hydrogel. Gene expression analysis underscored that some folliculogenesis-related genes (ZP3, BMP7, and GJA1) and a steroidogenic gene (CYP19A1) demonstrated higher expression levels in HA-SH encapsulated follicles versus ALG. Collectively, our findings advocate for HA-SH hydrogel as a potent biomaterial for in vitro follicle cultures, attributing its efficacy to facile gelation, bio-responsiveness, and superior support for follicle growth.",['Royan Institute'],['Iran'],"['Dahmardeh T.', 'Ghanian M.H.', 'Ebrahimi B.']","['Alginate', 'Disulfide formation', 'Hyaluronic acid', 'In vitro culture', 'Preantral follicle']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,1,62.0,2023
Design of sustainable 3D printable polylactic acid composites with high lignin content,"© 2023In this study, we report the development of a sustainable polymer system with 50 wt% lignin content, suitable for additive manufacturing and high value-added utilization of lignin. The plasticized polylactic acid (PLA) was incorporated with lignin to develop the bendable and malleable green composites with excellent 3D printing adaptability. The biocomposites exhibit increases of 765.54 % and 125.27 % in both elongation and toughness, respectively. The plasticizer enhances the dispersion of lignin and the molecular mobility of the PLA chains. The good dispersion of lignin particles within the structure and the reduction of chemical cross-linking promote the local relaxation of the polymer chains. The good local relaxation of the polymer chains and the high flexibility allow to obtain a better integration between the printed layers with good printability. This research demonstrates the promising potential of this composite system for sustainable manufacturing and provides insights into novel material design for high-value applications of lignin.","['Northeast Forestry University', 'Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'Nanjing Forestry University']",['China'],"['Zhou X.', 'Ding K.', 'Chi X.', 'Cai L.', 'Ren Z.', 'Wei Y.', 'Xia C.', 'Ji T.', 'Xu M.', 'Sun H.']","['3D printing', 'Lignin', 'Polylactic acid']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,77.0,1979
LncHLEF promotes hepatic lipid synthesis through miR-2188-3p/GATA6 axis and encoding peptides and enhances intramuscular fat deposition via exosome,"© 2023 The AuthorsLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emergingly been implicated in mammalian lipid metabolism. However, their biological functions and regulatory mechanisms underlying adipogenesis remain largely elusive in chicken. Here, we systematically characterized the genome-wide full-length lncRNAs in the livers of pre- and peak-laying hens, and identified a novel intergenic lncRNA, lncHLEF, an RNA macromolecule with a calculated molecular weight of 433 kDa. lncHLEF was primarily distributed in cytoplasm of chicken hepatocyte and significantly up-regulated in livers of peak-laying hens. Functionally, lncHLEF could promote hepatocyte lipid droplet formation, triglycerides and total cholesterol contents. Mechanistically, lncHLEF could not only serve as a competitive endogenous RNA to modulate miR-2188-3p/GATA6 axis, but also encode three small functional polypeptides that directly interact with ACLY protein to enable its stabilization. Importantly, adeno-associated virus-mediated liver-specific lncHLEF overexpression resulted in increased hepatic lipid synthesis and intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition, but did not alter abdominal fat (AbF) deposition. Furthermore, hepatocyte lncHLEF could be delivered into intramuscular and abdominal preadipocytes via hepatocyte-secreted exosome to enhance intramuscular preadipocytes differentiation without altering abdominal preadipocytes differentiation. In conclusion, this study revealed that the lncHLEF could promote hepatic lipid synthesis through two independent regulatory mechanisms, and could enhance IMF deposition via hepatocyte-adipocyte communications mediated by exosome.","['International Joint Research Laboratory for Poultry Breeding of Henan', 'Henan Agricultural University', 'Medical University of South Carolina', 'Henan Key Laboratory for Innovation and Utilization of Chicken Germplasm Resources']","['United States', 'China']","['Tian Y.', 'Jiang R.', 'Kang X.', 'Wang H.', 'Li Z.', 'Li H.', 'Tian W.', 'Zhang K.', 'Wang Y.', 'Wu X.', 'Sun G.', 'Liu X.', 'Zhi Y.', 'Wang D.', 'Wang Z.', 'Li G.', 'Yang L.', 'Guo Y.']","['Adipogenesis', 'Chicken', 'Competing endogenous RNA', 'Exosome', 'lncHLEF', 'Peptides']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,70.0,2023
Phenolated alginate hydrogel induced osteogenic properties of mesenchymal stem cells via Wnt signaling pathway,"© 2023Osteogenic properties of phenolated alginate (1.2 %) hydrogel containing collagen (0.5 %)/nano-hydroxyapatite (1 %) were studied on human mesenchymal stem cells in vitro. The phenolation rate and physical properties of the hydrogel were assessed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning electron microscope (SEM), swelling ratio, gelation time, mechanical assay, and degradation rate. The viability of encapsulated cells was monitored on days 7, 14, and 21 using an MTT assay. Osteoblast differentiation was studied using western blotting, and real-time PCR. Using PCR array analysis, the role of the Wnt signaling pathway was also investigated. Data showed that the combination of alginate/collagen/nanohydroxyapatite yielded proper mechanical features. The addition of nanohydroxyapatite, and collagen reduced degradation, swelling rate coincided with increased stiffness. Elasticity and pore size were also diminished. NMR and FTIR revealed suitable incorporation of collagen and nanohydroxyapatite in the structure of alginate. Real-time PCR analysis and western blotting indicated the expression of osteoblast-related genes such as Runx2 and osteocalcin. PCR array revealed the induction of numerous genes related to Wnt signaling pathways during the maturation of human stem cells toward osteoblast-like cells. In vivo data indicated that transplantation of phenolated alginate/collagen/nanohydroxyapatite hydrogel led to enhanced de novo bone formation in rats with critical-sized calvarial defects.

Antibacterial polylactic acid fabricated via Pickering emulsion approach with polyethyleneimine and polydopamine modified cellulose nanocrystals as emulsion stabilizers,"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.Antibacterial biodegradable plastics are highly demanded for food package and disposable medical plastic consumables. Incorporating antibacterial nanoagents into polymer matrices is an effective method to endow polymers with antibacterial activity. However, synthesis of sustainable antibacterial nanoagents with high antibacterial activity via facile approach and well dispersion of them in polymer matrices are still challenging. In this study, polyethyleneimine (PEI) was grafted on surface of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) via the oxidation self-polymerization of dopamine (DA) and the Michael addition/Schiff base reaction between DA and PEI. The resulted PEI and polydopamine modified CNCs (PPCs) showed substantially enhanced antibacterial activity and reduced cytotoxicity for NIH3T3 than PEI due to increased local concentration and anchoring of PEI. The minimum concentration of PPCs to achieve antibacterial rate of 99.99 % against S. aureus and E. coli were about 50 and 20 μg/mL, respectively. PPCs displayed outstanding emulsifying ability, and PPC coated polylactic acid (PLA) microspheres were obtained by drying PPC stabilized PLA Pickering emulsion, leading to a well dispersion of PPCs in PLA. PPC/PLA film prepared by hot-pressing displayed great antibacterial performance and enhanced mechanical properties. Therefore, this study proposed a facile approach to fabricate biocompatible antibacterial nanoagents and plastics.","['South China Normal University', 'Huazhong University of Science and Technology', 'ScienceK Ltd.', 'Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology']","['China', 'Canada']","['Yang G.', 'Zhou G.', 'Shi Y.', 'Ding Y.', 'Zhong M.', 'Wang Y.', 'Tam K.C.', 'Tang B.', 'Xiang H.', 'Zhang Z.']","['Antibacterial polylactic acid', 'Cellulose nanocrystal', 'Pickering emulsion']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,60.0,2023
"An injectable and light curable hyaluronic acid composite gel with anti-biofilm, anti-inflammatory and pro-healing characteristics for accelerating infected wound healing","© 2023 The AuthorsBacterial biofilm formation and drug resistance are common issues associated with wound healing. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a new class of antimicrobial agents with the potential to solve these global health issues. New injectable adhesive antibacterial hydrogels have excellent prospects of becoming the next innovative wound-healing dressings. In this study, the hyaluronic acid was connected to the antibacterial peptide Plantaricin 149 (Pln149), obtaining HAD@AMP. HAD@AMP performed well in efficient antimicrobial activity, good histocompatibility, low drug resistance, low bacterial biofilm formation, and fast wound healing process which are essential for rapid healing of infected wound. During the hydrogel degradation process, Pln149 was released to inhibit bacterial communication and reduce bacterial biofilm formation. Meanwhile, HAD@AMP could up-regulate anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic factors, and down-regulate inflammatory factors to promote the healing of infected wounds, which provide a new idea for skin healing strategies.","['Zhejiang University School of Medicine', 'The Second Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine']",['China'],"['Xu J.', 'Zhang L.', 'He F.', 'Lei Y.', 'Fu T.', 'Wang S.', 'Xie Z.', 'Lin X.']","['Anti-inflammatory', 'Antimicrobial peptide', 'Hydrogel', 'Wound healing']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,36.0,2023
Effect of peach gum polysaccharide on the rheological and 3D printing properties of gelatin-based functional gummy candy,"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.Excellent 3D printing materials must exhibit good extrudability and supportability, but these two characteristics are often contradictory. In this study, peach gum polysaccharide (PGP) was added to gelatin to prepare a 3D-printed functional gummy candy encapsulating curcumin. Rheology tests indicated that adding PGP could effectively improve the apparent viscosity and thermal stability and consequently improve the 3D printability and supportability of the products. When PGP addition was 6 %, the printing accuracy was higher than 90 %. Texture and microstructure analysis further revealed that PGP addition promoting a dense gel structure formed and the water holding capacity and supportability of gel materials were enhanced. Furthermore, the in vitro gastrointestinal digestion tests showed that after 6 h of simulated gastrointestinal fluid digestion, the retention rate of curcumin was nearly 80 %.

"Physicochemical, antibacterial and food preservation properties of active packaging films based on chitosan/ε-polylysine-grafted bacterial cellulose","© 2023To address the environmental and food contamination issues caused by plastics and microorganisms, antimicrobial films using natural polymers has attracted enormous attention. In this work, we proposed a green, convenient and fast approach to prepare antimicrobial films from chitosan (CS), bacterial cellulose (BC) and ε-polylysine (ε-PL). The effects of different concentrations of ε-PL (0 %, 0.25 %, 0.5 %, 0.75 %, 1 %, w/v) on the physicochemical properties and antibacterial activity of composite films (CS-DABC-x%PL) were systematically investigated. Furthermore, a comprehensive comparison with purely physically mixed CS-BC-x%PL films provides a deeper understanding of the subject matter. Characterization tests of the films were conducted using scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results suggested that the incorporation of 0.5 % ε-PL reduced the water solubility of the composite film by 19.82 %, along with improved the tensile strength and thermal stability by 37.31 % and 28.54 %. As ε-PL concentration increased to 1 %, the antibacterial performance of the films gradually enhanced. Additionally, the CS-DABC-0.5%PL film demonstrated effectiveness in delaying the deterioration of tilapia. These findings imply that this novel green packaging material holds significant potential in food preservation due to its promising antibacterial properties.","['Jiangnan University', 'Guelph Research and Development Centre']","['China', 'Canada']","['Sun X.', 'Zhao Q.', 'Lu Z.', 'Liu X.', 'Liao W.', 'Feng A.']","['Bacterial cellulose', 'Chitosan', 'Composite film']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,60.0,1979
In vitro and in vivo immuno-enhancing effect of fucoidan isolated from non-edible brown seaweed Sargassum thunbergii,"© 2023Fucoidan has been reported to have various biological activities, such as antioxidant, antitumor and anticoagulant, with various health benefits. However, few studies have been conducted to extract fucoidan from Sargassum thunbergii in terms of its immuno-enhancing activities. This aim of this study was to investigate the immuno-enhancing effect of fucoidan (S3) isolated from Sargassum thunbergii through water extraction and ethanol precipitation in RAW 264.7 macrophages and zebrafish. The results showed that S3 contained a relatively high content of fucose and sulfated polysaccharide. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results show that the characteristic peaks at 845 cm−1 and 1220-1270 cm−1 indicate that S3 contains sulfate groups. In vitro, S3 effectively enhanced nitric oxide (NO) production and phagocytic activity. In addition, the results of the study demonstrated that the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and IL-10 was upregulated by nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo, S3 activates zebrafish immune responses by promoting secretion of NO and activating the NF-κB pathway. Overall, these results suggest that S3 could be used as a functional ingredient added to nutritional supplements and functional foods.","['Jeju National University', 'Pukyong National University']",['South Korea'],"['Nagahawatta D.P.', 'Ryu B.', 'Yang F.', 'Heo M.-S.', 'Yang H.-W.', 'Jeon Y.-J.', 'Je J.-G.', 'Lee H.-G.']","['Fucoidan', 'Immuno-enhancing', 'NF-κB', 'Sargassum thunbergii', 'Water extract']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,40.0,1220
Structural characteristics and structure-activity relationship of four polysaccharides from Lycii fructus,"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.At present, the structure-activity relationship of polysaccharides is a common and important focus in the fields of glycobiology and carbohydrate chemistry. To better understand the effect of specific polysaccharide structures on bioactive orientation, four homogeneous polysaccharides from Lycii fructus, one neutral along with three acidic polysaccharides, were purified, structurally characterized and comparatively evaluated on the antioxidative and anti-aging activities. The GC–MS-based monosaccharide composition analysis and methylation results showed that the LFPs had similar glycosyl types but varied proportions. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy showed that LFPs consisted of arabinogalactan, rhamnogalacturonan and homogalacturonan structural domains. The results of the structure-activity relationship indicated that the antioxidative activity was positively correlated with the galacturonic acid (GalA) content, while the neutral multi-branched chains might be responsible for the anti-aging activity. This study is the first time to compare the principal structures and multiple biological activities of LFPs, which provided a reference for the industrial development and deep excavation of the health value of LFPs.","['Nanjing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine', 'Ltd.', 'Ningxia Innovation Center of Goji R &amp; D']",['China'],"['Yu Z.', 'Liang X.', 'Guo S.', 'Zhang F.', 'Wei Y.', 'Tong L.', 'Zhang W.', 'Duan J.-A.', 'Kang H.', 'Liu M.']","['Lycii fructus', 'Polysaccharides', 'Structural characteristics', 'Structure-activity relationship']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,59.0,2023
Piperine modulates IR/Akt/GLUT4 pathways to mitigate insulin resistance: Evidence from animal and computational studies,"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.The global prevalence of diabetes mellitus is rising, especially in India. Medicinal herbs, whether used alone or in combination with conventional medicines, have shown promise in managing diabetes and improving overall well-being. Piperine (PIP), a major bioactive compound found in pepper, is gaining attention for its beneficial properties. This study aimed to assess whether PIP could alleviate diabetes by targeting insulin pathway-related molecules in the adipose tissue of rats on a high-fat diet (HFD). After 60 days on the HFD, rats received PIP at a dose of 40 mg/kg body weight for one month. The results showed that PIP significantly improved metabolic indicators, antioxidant enzymes, and carbohydrate metabolic enzymes. It also regulated the mRNA and protein expression of insulin signaling, which had been disrupted by the diet and sucrose intake. Molecular docking analysis also revealed strong binding of PIP to key diabetes-related regulatory proteins, including Akt (−6.2 kcal/mol), IR (−7.02 kcal/mol), IRS-1 (−6.86 kcal/mol), GLUT4 (−6.24 kcal/mol), AS160 (−6.28 kcal/mol), and β-arrestin (−6.01 kcal/mol). Hence, PIP may influence the regulation of glucose metabolism through effective interactions with these proteins, thereby controlling blood sugar levels due to its potent antilipidemic and antioxidant properties. In conclusion, our study provides in vivo experimental evidence against the HFD-induced T2DM model for the first time, making PIP a potential natural remedy to enhance the quality of life for diabetic patients and aid in their management.","['College of Sciences', 'King Saud University', 'Qilu University of Technology', 'Saveetha Dental College And Hospitals']","['India', 'China', 'Saudi Arabia']","['Prasad M.', 'Palanisamy C.P.', 'Natarajan S.R.', 'Veeraraghavan V.P.', 'Elrobh M.', 'Gatasheh M.K.', 'Krishnamoorthy R.', 'Jayaraman S.']","['Adipose tissue', 'High-fat diet and sucrose', 'Insulin signaling', 'Piperine', 'Type-2 diabetes']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,55.0,2023
Structural characterization of modified coconut husk lignin via steam explosion pretreatment as a renewable phenol substitutes,"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.The effects of steam explosion (SE) pretreatment on the structural properties of lignin isolated from coconut husk (CH) biomass via soda pulping were investigated in this work. The isolated SE lignin was classified as dilute acid impregnation SE lignin (ASEL), water impregnation SE lignin (WSEL), and 2-naphthol impregnation SE lignin (NSEL). The various types of functional groups isolated from SE lignin were characterized and compared using a variety of complementary analyses: FTIR spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, GPC chromatography, HPAEC-PAD chromatography and thermal analyses. It was revealed that ASEL has the highest solid recovery with 55.89 % yield as well as the highest sugars content compared to WSEL (45.66 % yield) and NSEL (49.37 % yield). Besides, all isolated SE lignin contain a significant quantity of non-condensed G-type and S-type units but less amount of H-type units as supported by previous research. The SE lignin produced lignin with higher molecular weight (Mw ASEL: 72725 g mol−1 > Mw WSEL: 13112 g mol−1 > Mw NSEL: 6891 g mol−1) seems to influence the success of the synthesis reaction of phenolic resins.

In this study, inspired by the layered structure of natural nacre, we present a novel biomimetic composite insulating film (referred to as M/C film) that is derived from agricultural waste corncobs and industrial waste mica tailings through a sol-gel-film transformation process. The novel insulating film has excellent tensile strength (94 MPa), high dielectric strength (68 kV mm−1), low dielectric loss, good heat resistance (T0 = 235 °C), and excellent UV shielding properties. Meanwhile, the M/C film presents environmental impacts much lower than those petrochemical-based plastic film as it can be 100 % recycled in a closed-loop recycling process and easily biodegraded in the environment (lignocellulose goes back to the carbon cycle and the mica return to the geological cycle). It is a potential alternative for petrochemical plastics and provides a possible way to utilize agricultural waste and mica tailings.","['Hubei University of Technology', 'Ltd.']",['China'],"['Xie Y.', 'Feng Q.', 'Zhang X.', 'Lian J.', 'Li X.', 'Shen J.', 'Wu Y.', 'Yang Z.', 'Li J.']","['All-nature', 'Bioinspiration', 'Electrical insulating composite', 'Lignocellulose', 'Mica tailing']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,47.0,2023
Media-milled agar particles as a novel emulsifier for food Pickering emulsion,"© 2023Pickering emulsions was successfully fabricated using ball-milled agar particles with sizes and sulfate content around 7 μm and 0.62 %, respectively. These particles were obtained through a simple media-milling process using agar powders initially sized at 120 μm. The lamellated agar is aggregated into a mass after the milling process. The surface charge and hydrophobicity of the ball-milled agar particles were characterized through zeta potential and contact angle measurements, respectively. The droplet size of Pickering emulsions was related to oil fraction and particle concentration, ranging from approximately 45 μm to 80 μm. Ball-milled agar stabilized emulsions were sensitive to pH and salt conditions. The results of confocal laser scanning microscopy and cryo-SEM showed that at low particle concentrations and oil fractions, ball-milled agar stabilized the emulsions by dispersing particles on the surface of the oil droplets through electrostatic repulsion. Conversely, ball-milled agar stabilized the emulsions under high particle concentrations and oil fractions by forming a gel network structure to bind the oil droplets. In this research, this developed method provides the basis for the high-value application of agar and a new idea for preparing stable food-grade Pickering emulsion-based functional foods using raw-food material without surface wettability.","['Fujian Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Marine Functional Food', 'National R&amp;D Center for Red Alga Processing Technology', 'Jimei University', 'Xiamen Key Laboratory of Marine Functional Food']",['China'],"['Chen J.', 'Xiao A.', 'Ru Y.', 'Zhang Y.', 'Xiao Q.', 'Weng H.', 'Liang G.', 'Chen Z.']","['Agar', 'Food-grade Pickering emulsion', 'Media milling']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,43.0,1979
Investigation of 3D printing of toddler foods with special shape and function based on fenugreek gum and flaxseed protein,"© 2023 Elsevier B.V.The practicability of using corn and flaxseed protein as printing inks for manufacture of printed products specifically designed for toddlers as a dysphagia diet with high precision and special shapes with addition of fenugreek gum (FGG) was investigated. 3D printing was used to process grains and dysphagia-compatible food (corn) into a dietary product with attractive appearance which was also easy to swallow. Rheological measurements shown that appropriate amount of flaxseed protein (FP, 0–10 %) can reduce the stickiness and yield strength of printing material. Based on FTIR measurements, FP weakened the hydrogen bond strength of inks, but it was still an important gradient for the formation of the ink suitable for precision 3D printing. The TPA results shown that the addition of FP (0–10 %) remarkably reduced both the stickiness and hardness of the ink. These results shown that compared with the control group, materials with FGG additions possessed higher printing accuracy and self-supporting ability. Ink with 5 % FP content exhibited the best printability and swallowability, while ink with 10 % FP content had the lowest viscosity and hardness, but it was not suitable for 3D printing. 3D printing of objects printed using Ink-C (5%FP and 0.8 %FGG) showed high support characteristic and attractive appearance. According to the international IDDSI testing standards, Ink-C (5%FP and 0.8 %FGG), Ink-E (15%FP and 0.8 %FGG), and Ink-F (20%FP and 0.8 %FGG) were defined as level 5-minced and moist foods.","['Changxing Shiying Science &amp; Technology Co.', 'Jiangnan University', 'Université McGill']","['China', 'Canada']","['Niu D.', 'Mujumdar A.S.', 'Li J.', 'Zhang M.']","['3D printing', 'Dysphagia', 'Fenugreek gum', 'Flaxseed protein', 'Toddler food']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,56.0,2023
"Efficient separation and production of high-quality rubber, lignin nanoparticles and fermentable sugars from Eucommia ulmoides pericarp via deep eutectic solvent pretreatment","© 2023 Elsevier B.V.The natural barriers of lignocellulose hinder the separation of Eucommia ulmoides rubber (EUR) from Eucommia ulmoides pericarp (EUP), whereas traditional separation methods normally lead to the waste of Eucommia ulmoides lignocellulose resource and environmental pollution. In this study, an acidic deep eutectic solvent composed of lactic acid and ZnCl2 was developed as a pretreatment medium to reduce the separation barriers of EUR while producing lignin nanoparticles and fermentable sugars. Results showed that DES pretreatment could accelerate the extraction efficiency (91.0 %) and purity (>99 %) of EUR and maintain its chemical structure compared to the traditional alkaline and mechanical methods. Meanwhile, the regenerated nano-lignin showed excellent antioxidant activity (IC50 = 46.3 μg/mL) comparable to commercial antioxidant BHA. Besides, the enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency of EUP with DES pretreatment was significantly enhanced about 9 times than the control groups. Overall, the acidic DES pretreatment could be considered a promising pretreatment method for separation of high-quality EUR and valorization of lignocellulosic components.",['Northwest A&amp;F University'],['China'],"['Zhu M.', 'Pan Y.', 'Yin S.', 'Yao X.', 'Ma X.']","['Enzymatic hydrolysis', 'Eucommia ulmoides rubber', 'Lignin']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,47.0,2023
Assessing the interaction between hemoglobin and the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein through MARTINI coarse-grained molecular dynamics,"© 2023 The AuthorsThe emergence of different coronavirus-related diseases in the 2000's (SARS, MERS, and Covid-19) warrants the need of a complete understanding of the pathological, biological, and biochemical behavior of this class of pathogens. Great attention has been paid to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, and its interaction with the human ACE2 has been thoroughly investigated. Recent findings suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 components may interact with different human proteins, and hemoglobin has very recently been demonstrated as a potential target for the Spike protein. Here we have investigated the interaction between either adult or fetal hemoglobin and the receptor binding domain of the Spike protein at molecular level through advanced molecular dynamics techniques and proposed rational binding modes and energy estimations. Our results agree with biochemical data previously reported in literature. We also demonstrated that co-incubation of pulmonary epithelial cells with hemoglobin strongly reduces the pro-inflammatory effects exerted by the concomitant administration of Spike protein.","['Università degli Studi di Padova', 'University of Ferrara']",['Italy'],"['Marzaro G.', 'Gambari R.', 'Chilin A.', 'Gasparello J.', 'Verona M.']","['Hemoglobin', 'Metadynamics', 'Molecular dynamics', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Spike-protein']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,52.0,2023
Microwave radiation induces modifications in the protein fractions of tef flours and modulates their derived techno-functional properties,"© 2023 The AuthorsThe impact of microwave (MW) treatments on the structure, solubility, and techno-functional properties of the proteins in starchy matrices is still poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the effects of MW intensity by applying 1, 2, and 6 min of radiation on two tef flour varieties moistened at 15 % and 25 %. The fractionation method recovered ∼83 % of the total protein content in untreated flours. The interaction between treatment time and moisture content (MC) significantly influenced the extraction of protein fractions. Samples treated at 25 %MC showed significant reductions in albumins (up to −74 %), globulins (up to −79 %), and prolamins (up to −32 %). The SDS-extractable proteins of both tef flours presented similar molecular weights (12–100 kDa). SDS-PAGE analysis revealed decreased band intensity in MW-treated samples compared to untreated flours, and confocal analysis showed changes in the native state of proteins in treated samples. Shorter treatments at low MC significantly improved the emulsifying stability of tef flours, particularly in brown tef flour, with an enhancement of up to 203 %. The hydration properties significantly increased in flours treated at 25 %MC for 6 min. Pearson correlation analysis demonstrated the influence of treatment time and MC on protein recovery and functional properties of tef flours.","['Universidad de Valladolid', 'Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras']","['Honduras', 'Spain']","['Nathia-Neves G.', 'Calix-Rivera C.S.', 'Ronda F.', 'Villanueva M.']","['Physical modification', 'Protein fractionation', 'Tef proteins']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,56.0,2023
Polymorphism of G-quadruplexes formed by short oligonucleotides containing a 3′-3′ inversion of polarity: From G:C:G:C tetrads to π–π stacked G-wires,"© 2023 The AuthorsG-wires are supramolecular DNA structures based on the G-quadruplex (G4) structural motif obtained by the self-assembly of interlocked slipped G-rich oligonucleotide (ON) strands, or by end-to-end stacking of G4 units. Despite the increasing interest towards G-wires due to their potential applications in DNA nanotechnologies, the self-assembly process to obtain G-wires having a predefined length and stability is still neither completely understood nor controlled. In our previous studies, we demonstrated that the d(5′CG2-3′-3′-G2C5′) ON, characterized by the presence of a 3′-3′-inversion of polarity site self-assembles into a G-wire structure when annealed in the presence of K+ ions. Herein, by using CD, PAGE, HPLC size exclusion chromatography, and NMR investigations we studied the propensity of shorter analogues having sequences 5′CGn-3′-3′-GmC5′ (with n = 1 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 3) to form the corresponding G-quadruplexes and stacked G-wires. The results revealed that the formation of G-wires starting from d(5′CGn-3′-3′-GmC5′) ONs is possible only for the sequences having n and m > 1 in which both guanosines flanking the 5′-ending cytosines are not involved into the 3′-3′ phosphodiester bond.",['Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II'],['Italy'],"['Falanga A.P.', 'Oliviero G.', ""D'Errico S."", 'Greco F.', 'Terracciano M.', 'Borbone N.', 'Di Prisco D.', 'Piccialli G.', 'Marzano M.']","['DNA nanomaterial', 'G-quadruplex DNA', 'G-wire DNA', 'G:C:G:C tetrads']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Article,0,57.0,2023
Anti-inflammatory potential of ulvan,"© 2023 The AuthorsGreen seaweeds are a widespread group of marine macroalgae that could be regarded as biorenewable source of valuable compounds, in particular sulfated polysaccharides like ulvans with interesting biological properties. Among them, anti-inflammatory activity represents an interesting target, since ulvans could potentially avoid side effects of conventional therapies. However, a great variability in ulvan content, composition, structure and properties occurs depending on seaweed specie and growth and processing conditions. All these aspects should be carefully considered in order to have reproducible and well characterized products. This review presents some concise ideas on ulvan composition and general concepts on inflammation mechanisms. Then, the main focus is on the importance of adequate selection of extraction, depolymerization and purification technologies followed by an updated survey on anti-inflammatory properties of ulvans through modulation of different signaling pathways. The potential application in a number of diseases, with special emphasis on inflammaging, gut microbiota dysbiosis, wound repair, and metabolic diseases is also discussed. This multidisciplinary overview tries to present the potential of ulvans considering not only mechanistic, but also processing and applications aspects, trusting that it can aid in the development and application of this widely available and renewable resource as an efficient and versatile anti-inflammatory agent.","['Polígono Industrial', 'Universidade da Coruña', ""Universite Catholique de L'Ouest"", 'Universidade de Vigo', 'Complejo Hospitalario Universitario Juan Canalejo', 'Laboratoire de Biotechnologie et Chimie Marines (LBCM)']","['France', 'Spain']","['Blanco F.J.', 'Torres M.D.', 'Vaamonde-Garcia C.', 'Dominguez H.', 'Rodriguez-Coello A.', 'Latire T.', 'Bourgougnon N.', 'Florez-Fernandez N.', 'Meijide-Failde R.', 'Bujan M.', 'Muinos A.']","['Green seaweed', 'Inflammation', 'Sulfated polysaccharides']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,Elsevier B.V.,"['Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Structural Biology']",['BIOC'],Review,0,171.0,2023
